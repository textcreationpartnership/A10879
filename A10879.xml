            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE OF the Treatiſe of Humilitie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He fathers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, are frequent in obſeruing vpon the ancientes both of Greece and Rome, that many of them did excell in moſt of the morall vertues, for which they were much rewarded with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings by the open hand of almightie God; but that the vertue of humilitie, was ſoe farre from being poſſeſſed and
<pb facs="tcp:7498:3"/>
practiſed by any of them, as that they had not ſoe much as any apprehention, nor did they fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me any conceite at all thereof, and therefore hath not this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, any name at all in either of thoſe ancient, and learned ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues.</p>
            <p>That which the fathers ſaid of thoſe Gentiles, we their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may in ſome ſorte affirme of theis Proteſtants, for as much as may concerne the vertue of humilitie. For how ſoeuer they are acquainted with the name, yea and with the nature of it too, by ſpeculation of what is ſaid by vs, touching that ſubiect yet in order to practiſe and life,
<pb facs="tcp:7498:3"/>
the two Poles are not more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from one another, then they are from this vertue. For noe man either euer had, or can euer haue humility of will, till firſt he haue humilitie of the <hi>vnderſtandinge,</hi> and no creature can euer deuide himſelfe from the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, vpon preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that he knowes more of God almighties minde then it, but that this man muſt be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely proud. So that the very in trinſique forme of hereſy, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly pride, as on the other ſide, a man cannot poſsibly be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, but with all, he muſt infallibly be humble, for as
<pb facs="tcp:7498:4"/>
much, at leaſt, as may concerne the vnderſtanding part of his minde. Becauſe the very condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being à Catholicke, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes thus much, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer naturall repugnances he may chance to finde, in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this or that, he yet giues himſelfe wholly into the hands of the Church, and is ready ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to looſe a thouſand liues, then to credit his owne reaſon, againſt her rules.</p>
            <p>But yet Good Catholickes ſtay not heere, as if they were content to doe God homage by their vnderſtanding alone; but they ſeeke alſoe to range and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their will to the loue and
<pb facs="tcp:7498:4"/>
practiſe of this vertue. And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this is endeauoured, by ſuch amongſt vs, as enioy both the name, and nature of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men. Who as they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the great honour of being drawne neerer to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Majeſtie then the reſt, ſo God forbid but they should make it their buſines, to correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with that infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and greatenes, which can neuer be better done, then by acknowledging their owne ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenes &amp; weakenes.</p>
            <p>Of this I preſent you heere with a moſt liuely example. For this Treatiſe of humilitie, is not ſoe properly a booke, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:7498:5"/>
vpon that vertue, as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and aſpirations, and inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of a Religious man, who was breaking and bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Nouices committed to his charge, towards the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the world and the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them ſelues, by the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our lord Ieſus in that diuine vertue, which himſelfe in perſon came to plant. Now this you shall finde, not to haue bene done after a kinde of Proteſtant cutt; whoe (when they take vpon them to ſpeake to men of God, and good things) conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me their howers in generallities; ſcratching onely ſuch eares as itch, and not paſsing (as a man
<pb facs="tcp:7498:5"/>
may ſay,) beyond the very firſt skinne of the ſoule. And if any man eſteeme me to doe them wronge heerin lett them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front me by shewing ſuch a Proteſtant booke as this. I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne not that they should shew me ſuch a booke of humilitie, for ought I euer heard, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue neuer written booke of that vertue; but let them shew me any ſuch booke of any vertue, where the difinitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the thing in queſtion, is ſo cleere, where the diuiſion is ſoe exact, where the degrees are ſoe diſtinct, where the authorities are ſoe choice, where the examples are ſo proper, where the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:7498:6"/>
&amp; motiues are ſo conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and, aboue all, where the addreſſe &amp; exerciſe, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and examination, and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is ſo particular, ſo ſweete, and ſo ſtronge, and where the way is made ſoe eaſy, and ſmooth, for the arriuing to the moſt laborious iourneys end for flesh and blood, which is to be found in the whole world.</p>
            <p>It is highly glorious to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and it helpes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and more to Canoniſe the holy Catholicke Church, when men ſee that shee hath Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are ſo ſerious, ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and ſoe vigorous, as that when they are shutt vp hand to
<pb facs="tcp:7498:6"/>
hand with God, and without any other witneſſes, then bare walls, they are acquiring the higheſt humane perfection for themſelues, and imparting it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoe to one another, vpon the price of whatſoeuer flesh and blood holdes deere. And for my part I shall be of the Duke of Arcos minde, whoe wondring (in thoſe firſt beginnings of the Societie) how it was able to produce ſuch rare men (whilſt yet he vſed to meete them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe exteriour mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and auſterities either of habit or dyet, wherein other holy orders excell,) grew able afterward to make a good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
<pb facs="tcp:7498:7"/>
to his owne queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when he once came to ſee and weigh both theis works of F. Alfonſo Rodriguez, and many others, and by meanes thereof, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how they are wont to breede themſelues within doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and by the vſe of continuall prayer, and the ſolid and ſincere practiſe of the moſt heroicall vertues, to make themſelues, by the fauour of heauen, to beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me as ſoe many vnshake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towers or rocks, againſt the proud wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the whole world, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer there growes to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, of the greateſt glory of God, and the Good of man.</p>
            <p>And this is moſt true, but yet
<pb facs="tcp:7498:7"/>
it is not all that truth which we muſt fetch from thence. But it imports vs alſoe to conſider, that as Religious men are moſt obliged to procure Chriſtian perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the higheſt degree, and particularly this vertue of humilitie, in regard of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe vocation, and of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary helpes and meanes which they haue beyond ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar people, yet noe man who calls himſelfe Chriſtian muſt hold himſelfe exempt from the neceſsitie of attending to that vertue, which Chriſt our lord himſelfe came to teach, and the poſſeſsion whereof will carry and conduct men vp to heauen,
<pb facs="tcp:7498:8"/>
as the want thereof, did preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate thoſe rebellious Angells downe to hell; But there is a world of other motiues beſides this of punishments &amp; rewards which the diſcourſe enſueing will declare.</p>

And it is generally the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Doctors, and Saints, that pride is the beginning of all heriſes, when a man eſteemes his opinion and iudgment ſo much, that he preferes it before the common voice of the aints, and of the Church; and ſo he comes to fall vpon hereſies.

puffed vpp, and proude,</hi> and he imputes hereſies to puffing vpp and pride, as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> declares very well.</p>
               <p>The vertue alſo of <hi>hope,</hi> is conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and mainteyned by humilitie; becauſe the humble man, findes and feeles his neceſſitie, and knowes that of himſelfe, he can doe nothing, and ſo he reſorts to God more earneſtly, and places all his hope in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charitie</hi> alſo and the loue of God, is quickned and kindled by humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; becauſe the humble man knowes, that what ſoeuer he hath, comes to him from the hand of God, and that himſelfe is very farre from deſeruing it; and by this conſideration hee is much inflamed towards the loue of God. <hi>Quis eſt homo quia magnificas eu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aut quid apponis erga eum cor tuum?

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7498:17"/>
haue euer bene wout to ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that ſo they might be much inflamed with the loue of God.

My ſoule doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie our Lord becauſe he vouchſafed to looke vpon the baſenes of his, ſlaue.</hi> As for the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of men towards their neighbours, it is eaſily to be ſeene, how neceſſarie <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is.</hi> For one of thoſe things which is moſt wout to coole, and leſſen our loue to our neighbourgs, is to iudge of their faults, and to bould them to be full of imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and defects. But the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is very farre from this, for his eyes are euer caſt in vpon his owne errours, and he neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiders any thing in others but their vertues; and ſo he houlds al other men to be good, and himſelfe onely to be imperfect, and faultie, and vnworthy to liue amongſt his breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. And from hence is wout to growe a greate eſtimation, reſpect, and loue to them all. Beſides, the humble man
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7498:17"/>
is not troubled, that all men should be preferred before him, and that much accompt is made of them, and to, himſelfe a loue is forgotten; or that things of greater moment, are recommended to the care of others, and the leaſt and meaneſt to him. No enuy hath any place amonght humble men, for enuy ſprings from pride; and therefore if there be humility, there will be no enuy or contention, or any thing which may weaken a mans loue to his neighbours.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Humilitie</hi> alſo groues <hi>Patience,</hi> which is ſo neceſſary to all men in this life. For the humble man acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledges his faults and ſines and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders himſelfe to be whorthy of any punishment; and no affliction comes tho him, which he eſteemes not to be leſſe, then it should haue bene, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his faults; and ſo hee houlds his peace, and knowes not how to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine, but rather ſaith with the Prophet Michaeas, <hi>

               <p>Humilitie is alſo a mightie meanes towards Patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

Hee calls the preaching of the Ghoſpell, the diſpenſation of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which, grace is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>the miniſtery of Reconciliation. Et poſuit in nobis verbum reconciliationis; pro Chriſto ergo Legatione fungimur; God hath made vs his ſeruants, his Embaſſadors, as his Apoſtles were Legats of that cheife Bishop Ieſus Chriſt: tongues and inſtruments of the holy Ghoſt Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Deo exhortante per nos.</hi> Our Lord is pleaſed to ſpeake to ſoules by our tongues by theis tongues of flesh wil our lord mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the harts of men for this, haue we there fore more neede then others, of the vertue of <hi>Humilitie:</hi> and that vpon twoe reaſons firſt, becauſe by how much the more high our inſtitute and vocation is, ſo much more hazard shal we run, and ſo much greater will be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batte of vanitie and pride. <hi>The higheſt hills</hi> (as <hi>S. Ierome</hi> ſaith) <hi>are aſſaulted by the ſtiffeſt windes</hi> Wee are imployed in very high mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries, and for this are we reſpected and eſteemed ouer the world. We are held to be Saints, and euen for other Apoſtles vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, and that all our conuerſation is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and that our ſtudy is to make them alſoe Saincts. Whith whome we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſe: Here is neede of a greate foundation of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7498:22"/>
                  <hi>Humilitie,</hi> that ſoe high a building as this, may not be driuen downe to the groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. Wee had neede haue greate ſtrength of vertue, that wee may be able to beare the weight of honor, whith all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof. A hard taske it is, to walke in the midſt of honors, and that yet noe part thereof should faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it ſelfe to the hart. It is not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bodyes caſe, to haue a head that can be ſafe, ſoe high. O how many haue growne giddy and fallne downe from that high ſtate, wherein they were, for want of the foundation of <hi>Humilitie?</hi> how many whoe ſeemed Zagles, ſowringe vp in the exerciſe of ſeuerall vertues, haue through pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, become as blinde as batts. That Moncke wrought Miracles, of whome it is written in the life of <hi>S. Pachomius,</hi> and <hi>Palemon,</hi> that he walked vpon bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning coales, without hurting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but he growe proud vpon that very occaſion, and he though a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſtly of others; and ſaid (meaning of himſelfe) that he was a Saint, who could walke vpon coales, without burning himſelfe which of you ſaid hee can doe ſo much? Saint <hi>Palemon</hi> reproued him
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7498:22"/>
for this, perceiuing that it grew in him from pride; and at length he came to falle miſerably, and to end ill. The holy Scripture &amp; the hiſtories of Saints liues, are full of ſuch examples as this.</p>
               <p>For this doe we therefore ſtand in particular neede to be very well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this vertue; for if we be not, we shall runne greate hazard of being giddy, and of falling into the ſinne of pride; yea and that the greateſt of all others which is ſpirituall pride. <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> declaring this, ſaith, That there ar towe kindes of pride; one which concernes <hi>temporall things,</hi> and this is called <hi>carnall pride;</hi> and another which concernes <hi>things ſpirituall,</hi> and this is called <hi>ſpirituall pride;</hi> and he ſaith that this ſecond, is a greater pride, and a greater ſinne then the former. The reaſon hereof is cleere. For, as <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> ſaith the proud man is a theefe, and committs robbery; for he runs away with the goods of another, againſt the will of the owner; by hauing ſtolne the honor and glory which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God, and which he will not giue away but reſerue to himſelfe. <hi>Gloria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meam alteri non dabo,</hi> ſaith he by the Prophet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7498:23"/>
                  <hi>Eſay;</hi> and this, as I was ſaying, Doth the proud man ſteale from God, and he runs away with it, and applyes it to himſelfe. Now when a man growes proud of any naturall aduantage, as of nobility, of agilitie, and ſtrength of body, of quicknes of vnderſtanding, of learning, or the like, this man is a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but yet the theſt is not ſoe greate. For though it be true, that all theis bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are of God, they are yet but as the chaff of his howſe; but he who shall grow proud of his ſpirituall guifts, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely of sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctity, or of the fruite which is gathered by gayni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſoules, this is a great theefe, a famous theefe, a robber of the honor of God, and who ſteales thoſe iewells which he eſteemes the moſt rith, and of the greateſt price and valew, and which indeede were ſett at ſoe high a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, that he thought his owne blood and life, well imployed vpon the purchoſe thereof. For this reaſon, the B. <hi>S. Francis</hi> was full of care and feare leaſt hee should fall into pride, &amp; he was wont to ſay thus to God. <hi>O Lord if thou giue me any thinge, keepe it for me whoe dare not truſt my ſelfe with it, for I am noe better then a theefe, and am ſtill running away with thy goods.</hi> And now lett

               <p>It was not without greate miſtery, that Chriſt our Sauyour when he appeared to his Diſciples, vpon the day of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Aſcention, reproou'd them firſt for their incredulity, and hardneſſe of hart, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them afterward, to goe &amp; preach the Ghoſpell, wee the whole world, and gaue them power to worke many &amp; mightie miracles. For he giues vs hereby to vnderſtand, that he who is to be exalted, to the doenig of great things, hath neede to be humbled firſt, and to be abaſed in himſelfe, and to haue a true knowledge of his owne frailties &amp; miſeries, that ſoe, though afterward he come to fly aboue the heauens, and to woke miracles, he may yet remaine ſtill intyre, in the know ledge of himſelfe, &amp; ſticke faſt to the vnderſtanding of his

vpon our owne induſtry, or prudence, or other parts, but that we place all our confidence in God, and aſcribe and referre all to him, according to that of the wiſeman; <hi>Habe fiduciam in Domino, ex toto corde tuo, &amp; ne innitaris prudentiae tuae. Put your confidence in God with your whole hart &amp; rely not vpon your owne pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> And the reaſon heer of is (as afterw and I shall declare more at large) becauſe, when, through diſtruſt of our ſelues, wee place all our confidence in God, we aſcribe it all to him, &amp; put the whole buſines to his accompt; whereby we oblige him much, to take care thereof. O Lord diſpatch thine owne buſines, the conuerſion of ſoule is thine, and not ours; alas what pouer can we haue to ſaue ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les? But non when wee are confident in the meanes wee vſe, and in the diſcourſes which wee are able to make, we bring our ſelues to be parties to the buſines, &amp; attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but much to our ſelues, &amp; all that doe wee take from Almig tie God. They are like twoe ballances: for looke ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7498:25"/>
is onely his; &amp; thus he comes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt, that noe effect is wrought. And I pray God, that this be not ſome tymes the cauſe, why we doe our neighbours noe more good.</p>
               <p>We read in the life of our <hi>B. Father Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> that by certaine diſcourſes of the Chriſtian Doctrine which he made ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me tymes in <hi>Rome,</hi> with plaine, and rude, and improper words (for he was them nothing skilfull in the Italian tongue) he yet wrough ſoe great fruite in ſoules, that vpon the end of his ſpeech, his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours would haue their harts all wounded, &amp; came with ſuch ſighes, &amp; ſobbes, &amp; teares, to the feete of a Ghoſtly Father, that through exceſſe of greiuing and weeping they could hardly ſpeake. And this grew, becauſe he put noe truſt in his owne words, but onely in that Spiritt by which he ſpake. <hi>Non in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſibilibus humanae ſapientiae verbis, ſed in oſtentione ſpiritus, &amp; virtutis. Not in the perſwading words of humanae wiſedome, but in the manifeſtation of Spirit &amp; truth;</hi> as S. Paule ſaith. Hee was diſtruſtfull of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp; placed all his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidente in God; &amp; ſoe God gaue ſtrength and ſpiritt to thoſe inproper and rude words of his,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7498:25"/>
which ſeemed euen to dart burning fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, into the harts of his hearers. And nowe I know not, whether the reaſon why we produce not at this day, ſoe great fruit, be not becauſe we ſticke much cloſer to the opinion of our owne prudence; &amp; becauſe we reſt, and relie much vpon our owne meanes of perſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wation, and our learning, &amp; diſcourſe, &amp; our polite and elegant manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring our minds, and we goe guſtinge and delighting our ſelues much with our ſelues. O vell then, ſaith God, when you conceiue that you haue ſaid the beſt things, &amp; deliuered the moſt conuincing reaſons, and remaine content and iolly, with conceit that you haue done great matters, you shall then effect leaſt of all.

               <p>I ſay not, but that what ſoeuer men shall preach, muſt be very well ſtudyed, &amp; conſidered; but yet this is not all; for it muſt alſoe be very well wept vpon, &amp; very well recommended to God; and when you shall haue made your head ake with ſtudying, it, &amp; ruminatinge vpon it, you muſt ſay, <hi>Serui inutiles ſumus, quod debuimus facere, ſecimus.

end ſo high, and ſo ſupernaturall, as it is to conuert ſoules? No ſuch matter. But how comes it then to paſſe, that we are ſo vaine, &amp; ſoe very well pleaſed with our ſelues, when we thinke ſome good is done, and that our buſines ſucceedes well; as if we were the men who had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the deede? <hi>Numquid gloriabitur ſicuris, contra eum qui ſecat in ea, aut exaltabitur ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra contra eum à quo trabitur?

But yet, for as much as wee reduce all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to three, with <hi>S.

Wee all agree in this, <hi>that the knowledge of a mans ſelfe,</hi> is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and foundation whereby <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,</hi> is to be obteyned, &amp; the thinking of our ſelues as we deſerue. For how can we thinke of a man as he deſerues, if we know him not. This cannot bee. It is therefore neceſſary, firſt that we know what any man is, and then we may eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me or honor him more or leſſ, according to what wee knowe of him. Soe that ſtill you muſt firſt know what you are, and afterward according to what you are, you may eſteeme your ſelues; &amp; you shall haue good leaue to doe ſoe, for if

you eſteeme your ſelues for what you are, you will be very humble; for you will eſteeme your ſelues very little; but if you eſteeme your ſelues more then you deſerue, that will be pride. <hi>S.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et vs begin to ſound, and digg deepe into our ſelues, and into the knowledge of our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes and miſery, that ſoe we may diſcouer this moſt rich treaſure. <hi>Dragma perijt</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Ierome) &amp; tamen inueniturin ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core. In the very dunge of your baſenes, and of your infirmities, &amp; ſins, you shall finde that pretious pearle of Humilitie.</hi> Lett vs begin with our corporall being, &amp; lett that, be the firſt preſſing of the ſpade, as <hi>S. Bernard</hi> ſaith. <hi>Iſta tria ſemper in mente habeas, quid fuiſti, quid es, quid eris. Sett theis things euer before thine eyes, what thou wert, what thou art and what thou art to be. Quid fuiſti, quia ſperna foetidum? quides, quia vas ſtercorum? quid eris, quia eſca veruium?</hi> Haue euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7498:35"/>
thine eyes, what then waſt before thou wert ingendered which was, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thing ſoe ſtinking, and ſoe filthy, as that we may not giue it the true name. What art thou now? Thou art a veſſel full of dunge. What art thou to be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the foode of wormes? Wee haue heere, matter enough to meditate vpon, and to digg into. Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> ſaith very well. <hi>O vitis conditionis humanae indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitas; O indigna vilitatis humanae conditio. Herbas &amp; arbores inueſtiga; illae de ſe produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt flores, &amp; frondes, &amp; fructus; &amp; tu de te, lendes, &amp; pediculos, &amp; lumbricos. O baſe and vile condition of humane nature. Looke vpon the trees, and plants, and thou shalt finde that they produce beautifull leaues, and flowers, and fruites, but man produces out of himſelfe nitts, lice, and wormes. Illae de ſe effundunt olium, vinum, &amp; balſamum; &amp; tu de te, ſputum, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam &amp; ſtercus. Illae de ſe ſpirant ſuauitatis odorem, &amp; tu de te, reddis abominationem fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris. The plants and trees yeild out of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, oyle, Balſamum, and wine, and odours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoe of much ſweetenes; and man vtters a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand vncleaneſſes, of ſo abominable ſauour, as makes ones ſtomacke turne to thinke of it, and much more to name it.</hi> But in fine, <hi>Qualis ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor talis fructus, non enim poteſt arbor mala,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7498:36"/>
bonos fructus facere. Such as the tree is ſuch is the fruite like to be; for an ill tree can beare noe good fruite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verely, the Saints doe with much reaſon, and with great proprietie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the body of man, to a dunghill, ouer caſt with ſnow; which on the out ſide appeares beautifull and faire, but with in, is full of vglynes and vncleanenes. The Bleſſed <hi>S. Bernard</hi> ſaid, ſi diligenter conſideres, <hi>quid per os, &amp; nares, caeteroſque corporis meatus egrediatur, vilius ſterquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, nunquam vidiſti. If you put your ſelues to conſider what you want by your eyes, your eares, your mouth, your noſtrills, and the other ſincks of the body, there is not in the whole world, any other ſoe filthy dunghill, nor which vtters ſuch abhomination as this.</hi> O how well ſaid the holy <hi>Iob? What is man but rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe, and a very fountaine of wormes. Putredini dixi, pater meus es mater mea, &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror mea vermibus. I haue ſaid to rottenneſſe, thou art my father, and to the wormes I haue ſaid, you are my mother, and my bretherin.</hi> Such a thing as this is man, a very run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtreame of rottenneſſe, &amp; a wide ſacke, full of wormes. Well then, of what shall wee nowe be proud? <hi>Quid ſuperbit terra &amp; cinis? Of what will duſt and ashes,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7498:36"/>
take occation to bragg?</hi> At leaſt from hence wee shall be able to diſcouer, no coulour for being proud; but enough, for being humble, and to deſpiſe our ſelues. And therefore <hi>S. Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cuſtos humilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis eſt recordatio propriae faedi atis. It will helpe vs to conſerue Humilitie, it we remember our owne deformitie.</hi> It will be kept, very ſafe vnder theis ashes.</p>
               <p>Lett vs paſſe yet a little further on, &amp; digg yet deeper, &amp; preſſ the ſpade yet lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer into the ground. Conſider what you were, before God created you, and you shall finde that you were iuſt <hi>nothing,</hi> and that you could neuer haue bene deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of that darke Abiſſe of being <hi>nothing,</hi> if God, through his great mercy, and goodnes, had not taken you out from thence, and placed you amongſt his creatures, giuing you that reall, and true being which you now enioy. So that, for as much as is on our parts, we are <hi>nothing,</hi> and for our parts we are to hould our ſelues but equall to thoſe things which <hi>are not,</hi> and we muſt aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be to God, that wauntage which now we haue aboue them. This is that which <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith. <hi>Si quis exiſtimat ſe aliquid eſſe, cum nihil ſit, ipſe ſe ſeducit. If any man
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7498:37"/>
thinke, that he is any thing, he is deceiued; for of himſelfe hee is nothing.</hi> Wee haue heere diſcouered a greate deepe mine, whereby to enrich, our ſelues with <hi>Humilitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea and there is yet more in this; For euen now after we are created, and haue receiued our being, it is not we, who hould it, and who can conteyne it in our ſelues. It is not, as when the architect, hath built a howſe, which ſuſtaines it ſelfe when he hath leſt it, without nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him any more, whoe made it. It is not ſoe in our caſe; but now after we are created, we haue ſtill as greate neede of God, in euery moment of our liues, to the end that we may not looſe the being which we haue already, as we had, whilſt we were nothing, that we might growe to be. Hee is euer ſuſteyning &amp; holding vs vp, whith his hand of power, that ſo we may not againe fall downe, into that profound pitt of being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; out of which he tooke vs before. And ſoe ſaith <hi>Dauid Tu formaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me, &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſti ſuper me manum tuam. Thou o Lord didſt frame me, and thou didſt place thy hand vpon me; and this hand of thine o Lord, holds me ſtill faſt on foote, and conſerues me, that ſoe I may not againe returne to my former nothing.</hi> We
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7498:37"/>
are euer ſoe depending, and ſo hanging vpon this hand faſt oſt God, that if once this ſhould faile vs, and that he ſhould take of that hand, but for any one moment of our liues, in the ſame very moment we were diſpatched and we ſhould looſe our being &amp; ſo returne to our nothing, as when the ſunne is once hidden the earth is darke.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon ſaith the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Omnes gentes quaſi non ſint ſic ſunt coram eo, &amp; quaſi nihilum, &amp; ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne reputati ſunt ei. All Nations in the ſight of God, are as if they were not, and as nothing; and they are meere emptineſſe it ſelfe before him.</hi> This is that which we all are ſaying euery minute, namely that we are nothing, but yet I doubt that we ſay it onely with our mouthes, for I know not whether we vnderſtand what we ſay. O that we vnderſtood and felt it, as the Prophet vnderſtood, and felt it, when he ſaid thus to, God; <hi>Et ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia mea, tanquam nihilum ante te. I, O Lord, am as nothing, in thy ſight.</hi> Really, for my part, I am nothing, for I had noe being, and the being which now I haue, was not had by me of my ſelfe; but thou O lord didſt giue it me; and to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7498:38"/>
thee muſt I aſcribe it all; &amp; I haue nothing whereof to bragge or glory in my ſelfe, for I had nothing at all to doe therein. And thou O lord, art euer conſeruing me in being, and houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me ſtill faſt on foote, and thou art ſtill giuing me ſtrength, wherewith to worke. All being, all ſtrength, all power to worke, comes to vs from thy hand; for, on our part, we can doe nothing, and we are worth nothing, and in fine, are nothing. So that now of what ſhal we be able to wax proud? Will it be perhaps, of the <hi>nothing</hi> which we ſee, wee haue? Wee ſaid a while a goe; of what doſt thou grow proud, thou who art but duſt, and ashes? but now we may ſay, of what doeſt thou grow proud, O thou who art nothing, which, is leſſe then duſt and aſhes? What oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, or euen colour, can a thing of nothing take, for lookeing bigge, and growing proud, and houlding it ſelfe in ſome account? Infallibly none at all.</p>

               <p>LEt vs yet goe farther on, and digg and ſound deeper, into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelues. Let vs vſe the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de once againe. But what; Is there any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet deeper? doth anything lye lower then <hi>Nothing?</hi> yes; there doth, and much lower. What? the ſinne which you haue added to it. O what a deep pitt is this? It is much deeper then Nothing; for ſinning is much worſe then not beeing, and it were better for a man not to be, then to haue ſinned; and ſoe ſaid Chriſt our lord of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who ment to ſell him. <hi>Bonum erat ei, ſi natus non fuiſſet homoille. It had bene better for him, that he had not bene borne.</hi> There is not a place ſoe low, ſoe diſtant, and ſo deſpiſed in the eyes of God, amongſt all thoſe things which either are or are not; as thath man
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7498:39"/>
whoe is in mortall ſinne; diſinherited of heauen, the enimy of God, and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for all eternitie, to hell fire. And though now, through the goodnes of our lord, your conſciences are not char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with any mortall ſinne; yet, as for the knowledge of our nothing, vee called to minde that tyme, wherein we had noe being; ſoe for the knowing of our ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeneſſe and miſery, we are now to call that tyme to minde, wehen we were in ſinne. Conſider, in how wretched eſtate you were, when, in the ſight of God, you were vngratious, vgly, his enemyes, the Children of wrath obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to eternall torments, and then deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe your ſelues throughly, and abaſe your ſelues into the loweſt, and profoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt place that poſſibly you can for you may ſafely beleeue, that how much ſoeuer you humble and deſpiſe your ſelues, you will neuer be able to arriue, to that abiſſe of contempt, which he deſerues, whoe hath offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that infinite goodnes, which is God. This buſines hath noe botome at all: it is a moſt profound and infinite abiſſe; for till wee ſhall be able to ſee in heauen, how good God is, we ſhall neuer be able to know perfectly, how great
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7498:39"/>
an ill ſinne is, wich is committed againſt God, and how great a puniſhment he deſerues whoe commits it.</p>
               <p>O that we would contynue in this ponderation, and digge on, and ſtill ſound deeper into this mine of our ſinnes, and miſeries, how humble would we then be; in how ſmall accompt would we hould our ſelues; and how eaſily would we admitt to be diſeſteemed and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by all. Hee whoe hath bene a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to God, what contempt will he not endure for his loue? Hee who gaue God away for a fancy or toy, or for ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of an inſtant: he who offended his Creator, ad his lord, and deſerued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for euer in Hell; what dishonours, what affronts, or iniuries will not he be glad to receiue, in ſatisfaction for thoſe offences, wich he hath committed againſt the Maieſtie of God; <hi>Prius quam humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, ego deliqui, propterea eloquium tuum cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>todiui;</hi> ſaid the Prophet <hi>Dauid.</hi> Before that ſcourge came wherewith God hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and afflicted me, I had giuen him cauſe to inflict it; I had already ſinned, and therefore now I am ſilent, nor dare I complanie, for all is much leſſe then my ſinnes deſerued. Thou haſt not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7498:40"/>
me O Lord, according to my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, for what ſoeuer we are poſſibly able to ſuffer in this life, is meerely nothing in compariſon of that which any one of all our ſinnes, hath deſerued. Will you perhaps conceiue, that he deſerues not to be dishonored, and deſpiſed, whoe hath dishonored, and deſpiſed God? Do you not thinke it to be reaſon, that hee be lightly eſteemed, whoe ſett light by God? Will you not confeſſe, that that will, which durſt offend the Creatour of the world, ſhould, neuer from thence forward, doe any one thing which it pretends, or deſires, in puniſhment of ſoe vaſt a preſumption?</p>
               <p>And there is yet more in it, for though we may well hope, that through the mercy of God, he hath pardonned vs our ſinnes, yet, in fine we haue noe certainety thereof. <hi>Neſcit homo vtrum amore, an odio dignus ſit. A man knowes not,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>whether he be beloued, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred by God.</hi> And S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nihil mihi conſcius ſum, ſed non in hoc, iuſtificatus ſum. I feele not now, any remorce of conſcience concerning any ſinne; but yet I know not, for all this, whether I be iuſtified or noe.</hi> And woe be to me, if I be not, for though
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7498:40"/>
I be a Religious man, and though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert others, all that, will doe me little good. <hi>Si linguis hominum loquar, &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Charitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non habeam, nihil ſum. though I</hi> ſpeake ſaith S. <hi>Paule, with the tongue of Angells, though I haue the guift of Prophecy, and the knowledge of all ſciences; though I giue all my goods to the poore, nay though I should conuert the whole world, yet if with all, I haue not Charitie, all this will doe me noe good.</hi> Wo be to you if you haue not Charitie, and the grace of God, for els you are nothing, yea &amp; worſe then nothing. It is a great meanes to make a man very humble, and euer to thinke meanely of himſelfe, and to hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in low accompt, that he knowes not whether he be in ſtate of grace, or els of ſinne. I am ſure enough that I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God; but I am not ſure, whether I be forgiuen or no. And whoe then, with this will, once preſume to hould vp his head: whoe will not be confounded and humbled, as low as the earth, and euen below the earth? For this reaſon, ſaith S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> did God hide the knowledge of his grace from vs: <hi>Vt vnam gratiam cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam habeamus ſcilicet humilitatem, that ſoe we might the more certainly, haue the grace
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7498:41"/>
of Humilitie.</hi> And though this vncertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nety &amp; feare wherein God hath left vs, may ſeeme to be painefull, namely that wee know not with any expreſſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety, whether we be in his fauour or no: yet indeede euen this proceedes from fauour, and mercy in him, towards vs; becauſe this vncertainety is full of profitt to vs, for the obteyning of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> for the conſeruing it, and for the makeing vs not deſpiſe any other, how many ſinnes ſoeuer he may haue committed. For that other may perhaps be already pardoned for whatſoeuer ſinnes he may haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ad perhaps he may be more in Gods fauour; and for my part, I know not whether I be ſo or no.</p>
               <p>It ſerues alſoe for a ſpurre towards good workes, and to keepe a man from being negligent; and to make him walke on with feare and <hi>Humilitie,</hi> in the ſight of God; begging pardon and mercy of him, as we are aduiſed to do by the wiſeman. <hi>Beatus homo qui ſemper eſt pauidus. De pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiato peccato, noli eſſe ſine metu. Bleſſed is that man, whoe alwayes feares. And be not with out feare, euen concerning thoſe ſinnes, for which yow haue done pennance.</hi> This conſideration of our ſinnes, is a very effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7498:41"/>
meanes, to make vs put little value vpon our ſelues, &amp; to be euer humble, &amp; to liue, as it were, euen vnder ground; for there is much to be gotten &amp; digged vp from thence.</p>
               <p>If beſides we would ſtay, and conſider the defects and wounds, which originall ſinne hath cauſed in vs, how copious would that matter be which wee might finde therein, for our humiliation? How is our nature peruerted and corrupted by ſinne. For as a ſtone is inclined by the naturall weight thereof, to fall downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; iuſt ſoe, by the corruption of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, we haue a moſt actiue incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to loue honor, and profitt, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our ſence; and we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely awake towards all thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, which concerne vs; but ſtarke dead, towards thoſe others, which are ſpirituall and deuine. That, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds in vs, which in all reaſon, were to obey; and that obeyes, which ſhould commaund. And to conclude, vnder the out ſide, and poſture of men the appetites of beaſts lye concealed, and we haue harts which grow groueling towards the ground, <hi>Prauum eſt cor hominum, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutabile, quis cognoſcit illud? The hart of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7498:42"/>
man is wicked, and inſcrutable and who can arriue to the mallice thereof?</hi> The deeper you digg into this wall, the greater abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations will you diſcouer therein, as was ſhewed in that figure to <hi>Ezechiell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if now we will apply our ſelues, to conſider our preſent defects, we ſhall finde our ſelues very full of them; for theis growe euer out of our owne ſtore. How ſlippery are our tongues, and how ill guarded are our harts? How incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant are we in our good purpoſes, and how earneſt for our owne intereſt and guſt? How deſirous are we to fulfill our appetites? How full are wee of ſelfe loue? How ſtronge in the abetting of our owne iudgment and will? How liuely doe wee ſtill finde our paſſions? how intire our bad inclinations? and how eaſily doe we permitt our ſelues to be tranſported by them. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith very well, vpon thoſe words of Iob. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra ſolium quod vento rapitur, oſtendis poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam tuam, that a man is, with much reaſon, compared to the leafe of a tree.</hi> For as a leaſe is tourned, and toſt with euery winde, ſoe is man by the winde both of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and temptations. Somtymes he is troubled with anger: ſometymes he is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7498:42"/>
diſolued with vaine mirth; ſome tymes he is tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſported by the appetite of auarice ſome tymes of ambition, and ſome tymes of luſt, ſome tymes he is hoyſed vp by pride, and ſome tymes caſt downe by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate feare. And ſoe ſaid the Prophett <hi>Eſay: Cecidimus quaſi folium vniuerſi, &amp; iniquitates noſtrae quaſi ventus abſtulerunt nos. As the leaues of trees are shaken, and carried away by the winde, ſoe are we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultet and ſubdued by temptations.</hi> We haue noe habilitie, or ſtrength in vertue, nor in executing our good purpoſes, but indeed we haue enough, for which we may hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and confounde our ſelues, and that, not onely by the conſideration of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and ſinnes, but by the weighing alſoe of thoſe works, which ſeeme in our eyes to be very good. For if we will conſider, and examine them well, wee ſhall finde occaſion and matter enough, for which to humble our ſelues, by reaſon of the fault and imperfections, which commonly we mingle with them; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the ſame Prophet; <hi>Facti ſumus vt immundus omnes nos, &amp; quaſi pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus menſtruatae vniuerſae iuſtitiae noſtrae. We are become as one vnecleane, and all our iuſtice is like ſome filthy and polluted ragg.</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:7498:43"/>

               <p>But the Saints doe heere aduertiſe vs, of apointe which imports very much, namely that as we muſt not dwell vpon the knowledge of our infirmities and miſeries, leaſt we fall vpon diſtruſt and deſpaire, but paſſe on to the knowledge of the goodneſſe, the mercy, &amp; liberality of God, and place our whole confidence in him: ſoe alſoe muſt we dwell as little heere, but turne our eyes quickly in againe vpon our ſelues, and vpon our owne miſeries and frailties. For if we ſticke vpon the knowledge of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the mercy, and liberalitie of God, and forgett what wee are in our ſelues, we ſhall runne much hazard of preſumption and pride, and wee ſhall grow to be too ſecure of our ſelues, and to be ouer bould, and not ſoe doubtfull and carefull, as were fitt, which is a daungerous courſe, and hath bene the fundation &amp; roote of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7498:44"/>

O how many, who really were Saints, and great Saints, haue come by this meanes, to haue moſt wretched falls? Becauſe they forgott them ſelues; becauſe they made them ſelues too ſure, through the fauours which they had receiued from God? They grew to be full of confidence, as if there had already bene noe more danger for them, and ſoe they came mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably to diſtruction.</p>
               <p>Wee haue bookes which are full of ſuch accidents. S. <hi>Baſill</hi> ſaith, that the cauſe of that miſerable ſalle of king <hi>Dauid,</hi> both into adultery, and Murther, Was the preſumption which once he had when he was viſited by the hand of God, with abondance of conſolation; ſoe farr, as that he preſumed to ſay, <hi>Ego dixi in abundantia mea; non mouebor in aeternum. I shall neuer be altered from this ſtate.</hi> Well, ſtay a while, God will a little take of his hand: thoſe extraordinary ſauours, and regalos ſhall ceaſe, and you ſhall ſee
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7498:45"/>
what will happen. <hi>Auertiſti faciem tuam a me, &amp; factus ſum conturbatus.</hi> God leaues you in your pouerty, and then you will be like your ſelfe; and you ſhall know to your coſt, when you are once fallen, that which you would not know whilſt you were viſited and ſauoured by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. And <hi>S. Baſill</hi> alſoe ſaith, that the cauſe of the fall, &amp; denyall of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peeter,</hi> was the confiding and preſuming vaynly in himſelfe. <hi>Etiam ſi oportuerit me mori tecum, non te negabo, &amp; ſi omnes ſcandalizati fuerint in te, ego nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſcandalizabor. Becauſe he ſaid with arrogancy and preſumption, that thouhg all men should be ſcandalized, yet would not he be ſcandalized, but would rather dye with Chriſt;</hi> For this did God permitt, that he ſhould fall; that ſoe he might be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and know himſelfe. Wee muſt neuer giue way that our eyes may wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der from our ſelues, nor euer be ſecure in this life: but conſidering what we are, we muſt goe euer on, with great care of our ſelues, and with great doubt, and feare, leaſt the enemy, whome we carry ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout vs, put ſome tricke vpon vs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide ſome ſnare, into which he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vs to fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:7498:45"/>So that as we muſt not ſtay vpon the knowledge of our owne miſerye &amp; weakenes, but paſſe inſtantly on to the knowledge of the goodnes of God, ſoe neither muſt we ſtay vpon the knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of God, and his mercies &amp; fauours, but returne with ſpeede againe, to caſt our eyes downe vpon our ſelues. This is that <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, <hi>whereof one end is faſtned to the earth, in our knowledge of our ſelues, and the other reaches vp to the very hight of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> By this <hi>ladder</hi> muſt you aſcend and deſcend, as the Angels aſcended and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, by that other.

               <p>Thus did <hi>S. Katherine of Siena</hi> vſe this exerciſe, to free her ſelfe from ſeuerall temptations which the diuell brought againſt her, as ſhe herſelfe relates in her Dialogues, when the diuell would tempt her by way of confuſion, deſiring to make
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7498:46"/>
her beleeue that her whole life was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but errour, and abuſe, For then ſhe woud raiſe her ſelfe vp, but yet ſtill with humilitie, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God: and ſhe would be ſaying to this effect, <hi>I confeſſe o my Creator, that my whole life hath bene led in darkenes, but yet I will hide my ſelfe in the wounds of Chriſt Ieſus Crucified, and I will bath my ſelfe in his blood: and ſoe my wickednes shal be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, and I will reioyce in my Creator, and my lord. Lauabis me, &amp; ſuper niuem dealba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.</hi> And ſoe alſo, when the Diuell would offer to putt her vp to pride by tentations of a contrary kinde ſeekeing to make her thinke that ſhe was perfect, and pleaſing to God, and that there was noe cauſe why ſhe ſhould any longer afflict her ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, and lament her ſinnes: then would ſhe humble her ſelfe, and make the diuell this anſwere. <hi>O wretched creature that I am S. Iohn Baptiſt neuer committed ſinne, &amp; was ſanctified in his mothers wombe, and yet notwithſtanding all that was contynually doeing penance: And I haue comitted ſoe many defects, and haue neuer lamented them, no nor euen conſidered them as they deſerued.</hi> With this the diuell, not likeing to endure ſoe great <hi>humilitie</hi> on
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7498:46"/>
the one ſide, nor ſoe great <hi>confidence</hi> on the other, ſaid thus to her. <hi>Be thou accurſed and he alſoe vhoe hath taught thee this, for I know not how to make entrance heere, ſince if I abaſe thee by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thou raiſeſt thy ſelfe vp as high as heauen, by the conſideration of the mercy of God: and if I raiſe thee vp towards preſomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou abaſeſt thy ſelfe by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy ſinnes as low as hell by way of humilitie: yea and thou perſecuteſt me, euen in hell it ſelfe.</hi>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>TO the end that we may yet be more animated to this exerciſe of the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelues,</hi> we will goe on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring ſome great benefitts, and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which are conteyned therein. One of the cheiſe thereof, hath bene ſhewed already, namely, that this is the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and roote of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and the neceſſary meanes both for the purchaſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation thereof. One of thoſe antient Fathers being aſked how a man might doe to obtaine true <hi>Humilitie,</hi> made this anſwere: <hi>Si ſua tantummodo &amp; non alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius mala conſideret.</hi> If he conſider onely his owne ſinnes, ſounding and digging deepe into the knowledge of himſelfe, this man ſhall obtaine true <hi>Humilitie.</hi> This alone were ſufficient to make vs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend much to this exerciſe ſince it imports vs ſoe very much, towards the obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this vertue. But yet the Saincts
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7498:47"/>
paſſe further on, and ſay, that the humble knowledge of our ſelues, is a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine way towards the knowledge of God, then the profound ſtudy of all ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And the reaſon which S. <hi>Bernard</hi> giues is, that this is the moſt high ſcience of all others, and of the greateſt benefitt. For from hence, a man comes to the knowledge of God, which is giuen vs to be vnderſtood, as S. <hi>Bonauentu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e</hi> ſaith, by that miſtery of the holy Ghoſpell, which Chriſt our ſauyour wrought, vpon the perſon of that man whoe was borne blinde. For by laying duſt vpon his eyes, he gaue him both corporall ſight, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith to ſee himſelfe, and ſpirituall ſight alſo, weherewith to know and adore God. <hi>Sic Dominus nos caecos natos, per noſtri &amp; Dei ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiam, illuminat lutum vnde nati ſumus, liniendo ſuper oculos no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtros, vt primum incipiamus nos ipſos cognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, deinde ipſum illuminatorem noſtrum cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo proni adorare. Hee ſaith that to vs, whoe are borne blinde, through the ignorance both of God, and of our ſelues, god giueth, ſight by laying durt vpon our eyes whereof we were made, to the end that conſidering our ſelues whoe are but as a little durt, we may receiue that ſight, wehereby first, we may ſee
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7498:48"/>
and knowe our ſelues, and from thence may arriue to knowe God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this very thing doth our holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the church inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d tot teach vs, by that holy ceremony which it vſes in the begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Lent, when it layes duſt or aſhes ouer our eyes, and then ſayth this. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento homo quia puluis es, &amp; in pulue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem reuerteris. Remember o man that thou art duſt and that to duſt thou shalt returne.</hi> That ſoe knowing him ſelfe he may alſoe come to know God, and be troubled for hauing offended him, and doe pennance for his ſinnes. Soe that a mans ſeeing and knowing him ſelfe, and conſidering his baſenes, and his durt, is a meanes to come to the knowledge of God. And the more any man knowes his owne baſenes, he ſhall the more diſcerne the greatnes, and Maieſty of God. For <hi>oppoſita iuxta ſe poſita magis eluceſcunt. One contrary and one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame put by the other will make that other appeare the more.</hi> White laide vpon blacke appeares the more freſh and cleare. And ſo ſince man is the moſt extreame baſenes and God the moſt ſublime altitude, they are two contrary extreames, and from hence it is that the more a man knowes him ſelfe, in whome he findes that there
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7498:48"/>
is noe goodnes at all, but onely <hi>Nothing</hi> and ſinne, the more he findes the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and mercy, and liberalitie of God, who vouchſafes to loue vs, and as it were to conuerſe, with ſoe great a baſenes as ours is.</p>
               <p>From hence growes the ſoule to be greatly kindled and inflamed towards the loue of God, for it neuer giues ouer maruailing, and giuing thankes to God, for that man, being ſoe miſerable and ſoe wicked, God indures him vpon the earth, and dayly alſoe doth him many ſauours. For it happens often, that we cannot ſoe much as indure our ſelues, and that yet the goodnes and mercy of God towards vs is ſuch, as that not onely he indures vs, but hee is pleaſed to ſay of vs, <hi>Deliciae meae eſſe cum filijs hominum. My delight is to be with the ſonnes of men.</hi> What didſt thou finde O lord, in the ſonnes of men that thou ſhouldſt ſay <hi>my delights are to conuerſe with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this did the Saints ſoe much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the excerciſe of the <hi>knowlegde of them ſelues,</hi> that ſoe they might acquire a greater knowledge of God, and a greater loue to his diuine Maieſtie. This was that exerciſe and prayer, which <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:7498:49"/>
vſed. <hi>Deus ſemper ide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nouerim me, nouerim te. O my God, which art euer the ſane, and neuer changeſt; let me knowe my ſelfe, and lett me know thee.</hi> And this other was the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wherein the humble <hi>S. Francis</hi> ſpent the whole dayes and nights; <hi>who art thou O Lord, and who am I.</hi> By this way, came the Saints to a very high knowledge of God, and this is a very plaine and certaine way: and the more you digg downe into the knowledge of your ſelues, the higher ſhall you riſe, and the more ſhall you growe in the knowledge of God, and of his infinite mercy and goodnes. As alſoe on the other ſide, the higher you riſe, and the more you growe in the knowledge of God, the lower you will deſcend, and the more you will profitt in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your ſelues. For the light which comes to you from heauen, will ſhew you ſuch ſlutiſh corners in your ſowles, as will make yow aſhamed of that which, in the eyes of the world, wil ſeeme very fayre and Good. <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> ſaith, <hi>that as when the ſunne beames enter into any roome, euery moate of the ayre will shew it ſelfe; Sic &amp; cor radiis gratiae illuſtratum, etiam minima videt. So the ſoule being illuſtrated by the knowledge of</hi> God, and by the beames of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7498:49"/>
that true ſonne of Iuſtice, the very leaſt little things will inſtantly be ſeene; and ſoe the ſoule comes to hould that for fautly, which he whoe inioyes not ſoe great light, will eſteeme to be good.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon why Saynts are ſoe humble, and hould them ſelues in ſoe ſmall accompt, and the greater Saints they are, they are the more humble, and the accounte wherein they hould them ſelues is ſoe much the leſſe. For ſtill, as they haue more light, and greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, they know them ſelues better, and ſee that of theire owne ſtock, they cannot bragg, but onely of <hi>Nothing,</hi> and of <hi>Sinne.</hi> And howe much ſoeuer they knowe them ſelues, and how many faults ſoeuer they ſee in their owne ſoules they ſtill beleeue, that there are many more which they ſee not and conceiue that the leaſt parte thereof, is that which they can come to knowe, &amp; after this rate doe they eſteeme them ſelues. For as they beleeue that God is more good then they are able to comprehend, ſoe alſoe doe they beleeue, that themſelues are more wicked then they can vnderſtand. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, how much ſoeuer we conceiue or knowe of God, we cannot perfectly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7498:50"/>
comprehend him, but ſtill there will be more and much more to be conceiued, and knowne; ſoe how much ſoeuer we know our ſelues, and how much ſoeuer we humble, and deſpiſe our ſelues, We ſhall neuer be able to deſcend ſo lowe as to arriue to the profounditie of our miſery And this is noe exaggeration, but a cleere truth. For ſince man hath nothing of his owne ſtore, but <hi>Nothing,</hi> and <hi>Sinne,</hi> whoe will euer be able to humble and abaſe himſelfe ſoe much, as thoſe two Titles deſerue.</p>
               <p>Wee read of a Saint who deſired light of God to know her ſelfe, and ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſo much deformitie, and miſery in her condition, that ſhe was not able to endure it and then ſhe prayed thus to God. <hi>O lord not ſoe much, for I shall fainte vnder the burden.</hi> And father <hi>Auila,</hi> ſaith that he knew a certaine perſon, whoe begged of God many tymes, that he would make him ſee and know himſelfe. God opened his eyes a little, and it had like to haue coſt him deere. For hee ſaw himſelfe ſoe vgly, and ſoe abominable, that he vttered loud cryes and ſaid, <hi>O Lord I beſeech thee euen for thy mercies ſake, take this ſpectacle from before myne eyes, for I can
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7498:50"/>
looke noe longer vpon this figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence growes alſoe, that holy kinde of hate and deteſtation of them ſelues, in the ſeruants of God, whereof I ſpake before. For how much more they know the immenſe goodnes of God, and loue him more, ſoe much the more doe they abhorr them ſelues, as hauing bene oppoſites and enemyes of God, according to that of <hi>Iob. Quare poſuiſti me contrarium tibi &amp; factus ſum mihi metipſigrauis.</hi> They ſee that in themſelues, they haue the roote of all miſcheife which is the wicked and peruerſe inclination of our fleſh; and vpon this knowledge, they raiſe them ſelues vp againſt them ſelues, and abhorr them ſelues. Doe you not thinke it reaſon to abhorre him, who made you forſake and ſell ſoe greate a good as God is, for a little contentment or guſt? Doe you not thinke it reaſon for you to hate him, whoe made you looſe eternall glory, and deſerue Hell for euer; him who wrought you ſoe much hurt, and ſtill perſiſts in doeing it, Doe you not thinke that you haue cauſe to deteſt? Well now, this perſon is your ſelfe, an oppoſite and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of God, an oppoſite and enemy of your owne ſaluation.</p>

                  <p>That the knowledge of ones ſelfe, doth not cauſe diſmay, but rather giues courage and ſtrength.</p>
               </argument>
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>THere is another great benefitt, which growes from the exerciſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge amans ſelfe; that not onely it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes no diſmay, or baſe feare, as perhaps ſome might doubt, but rather a great hart and courage, towards all thoſe things which are good. And the reaſon of this is, that when a man knowes him ſelfe, hee ſees that here is noe colour, why he ſhould rely vpon him ſelfe, but that diſtruſting himſelfe, hee muſt put all his confidence in God, in whome he findes himſelfe ſtronge, and able for all things. Hence it is, that theis are the men who are apt to attempt, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take great things, and theis are they, who goe through with them. For in reguard they aſcribe all to God, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them ſelues, God takes the buſines in hand and makes it his, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7498:51"/>
holds it vpon his ownes accounte; and then he is wont to doe mightie things, and euen wonders, by the meanes of weake inſtruments. <hi>Vt oſtenderet diuitias gloriae ſuae in vaſis miſericordiae, quae prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit in gloriam. To shew the riches and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his mercies. God will doe wonderfull things, by instruments whoe are miſerable and weake.</hi> Hee vſes to put the treaſures of his mercy into the pooreſt veſſels, for thus doth his glory ſhine moſt. This is that which God ſaid to Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> when being euen tyred with temptations, he cryed out and begged, that hee might be deliuered from them; and God made him this anſwere: <hi>Sufficit tibi gratia mea, nam virtus in infirmitate perficitur. My grace shall be ſufficient for thee, how great ſoeuer thy temptations and miſeries may be,</hi> and then doth the power of God proue it ſelfe to be more ſtronge, and perfect, when the weakenes and infirmitie is more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. For as the Phiſition gaines more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour when the ſicknes which he cures is more daungerous, ſoe when there is more weakes in vs, our deliuery brings more glory to Gods arme and power; and ſoe doth <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> and <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi> expound this place. So that when a man
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7498:52"/>
knowes and diſtruſts himſelfe, and puts all his confidence in God, then doth his Maieſtie come and helpe; and when on the other ſide a man putts confidence in himſelfe, and in his owne diligences and meanes, he is forſaken by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. This ſaith Saint <hi>Baſile,</hi> is the cauſe why when we deſire to make our Prayers beſt and to haue moſt deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in certaine principall feſtiuities, it falls out many tymes, that we haue leſſe; becauſe wee put our confidence in our owne meanes, and in our owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, and preparations. And at other tymes, we are preuented with great benedictions, and ſweetenes, when; we looke for them leaſt, to the end that we may knowe, that this is an effect of the grace and mercy of our lord, and of no diligence or meritt of ours. So that a mans knowing his miſery and frailty: cauſes noe cowardiſe or diſmay, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giues courage and ſtrength, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it makes him diſtruſt him ſelfe, and place all his confidence in God. And this is alſoe that which the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>Cum infirmor tunc potens ſum;</hi> and againe, <hi>Cum humilior tunc exaltor.</hi> For thus doe both <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi> declare it. <hi>When I humble and a baſe my
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7498:52"/>
ſelfe and know that I am good for nothing, then am I exalted and rayſed vp.</hi> Whilſt I know and ſee my infirmitie and miſerie faſtning my ſelfe vpon God, I finde my ſelfe more ſtronge and more full of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, for hee is all my confidence and ſtrength. <hi>Et erat Dominus fiducia eius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heereby you may vnderſtand, that it is not <hi>Humilitie</hi> nor any thing which ſprings from thence, when there come to vs ſome tymes, certaine diſmaies, and deiections, concerning our little progreſſe in Spiritt, and when we feare that we ſhall neuer obtaine ſuch or ſuch a vertue, and neuer ouercome ſuch an ill condition or inclination; or that we ſhall not be fitt for this or that office, and miniſtery in which we are or may be imployed, by <hi>Obedience,</hi> as when we queſtion, whether we ſhall be fitt to take <hi>Confeſsions,</hi> or to be ſent to or fro in <hi>Miſsions</hi> or the like. This may ſeeme to be <hi>Humilitie,</hi> but many tymes it is not ſoe, but rather ſprings from pride. For ſuch a one, caſt, his eyes vpon himſelfe, as if by his owne ſtrength, and diligences, he were to goe through with that buſines; whereas he ought to caſt them vpon God, in whome we are to be full of confidence and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.

               <p>ONe of the principall meanes, which, for our parts, we are able to imploy, to the end that our lord may ſhew vs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and communicate greate graces and guifts to vs is, that we humble our ſelues, and know our owne frailty and miſery. And ſoe ſaid the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paule libenter igitur gloriabor in infirmitatibus meis, vt inhabitet in me virtus Chriſti. I will gladly glory in my infirmities, and weakenes, that ſoe the power of Chriſt may dwell in mee.</hi> And <hi>Sainct Ambroſe</hi> vpon thoſe wordes, <hi>Placeo mihi in infirmitatibus. I am pleaſed in my infirmities,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Si gloriandum eſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiano, in humilitate gloriandum eſt, de qua creſcitur apud Deum. If a Christian be to glory, it is to be in his owne pouertie, and miſerie, whereby he may increaſe and proſper, in the ſight of God. Saint Auguſtine</hi> brings that of the Prophett, to this purpoſe.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7498:54"/>
                  <hi>Pluuiam voluntariam ſegregabit Deus, haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditati tuae, &amp; infirmata eſt, tu vero perfeciſti eam.</hi> When thinke you, that God will giue the voluntary and ſweete rayne of his guifts, and graces to his inheritance, which is the ſoule of man? <hi>Et infirmata eſt.</hi> When the ſame ſoule ſhall vnderſtand her owne infirmitie, and miſery, then will he perfect it, and the voluntary and ſweete ſhower of his guifts and graces, ſhall fall downe vpon it. And as heere amongſt vs, the more our poore beggars diſcouer their wretchednes, and their ſoares, to rich and charitable men, the more they moue them to pittie, and the more almes they receiue at their hands, ſoe the more a man knowes and humbles himſelfe, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſes his miſery, the more doth he inuite, and incline the mercy of God, to take pitty, and compaſſion on him, and to communicate the guifts of his grace with the more abundance. <hi>Qui dat laſſo virtute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; his qui non ſunt, fortitudinem, &amp; robur multiplicat. For he giues ſtrength to the weake, and to them who are, as if they were not, he multiplyes courage and ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To declare in few words, the great benefitts and aduantages of this exerciſe, I ſay that the true knowledge of a mans
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7498:54"/>
ſelfe, is the vniuerſall remedy of al incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences. And ſoe in the queſtions which we vſe to aske in ſpirituall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, whence ſuch or ſuch a thinge vſes to grow, and what may be the remedy thereof, we may in effect anſwere in them all, that they proceede from want of a mans knowing himſelfe, and that the remedy thereof would be, to know and humble himſelfe as he ought. For if you aske whence it growes, that I iudge of my brethren, I ſay from the want of knowing my ſelfe. For if I would goe watching with in my ſelfe, I ſhould finde ſoe much for me to ſee and ſoe many miſeries to bewayle, that I would not marke the faults of others. If you aske from whence it comes, that ſome tymes I ſpeake ſharpe, and vnmortified words to my brethren; that alſoe growes from the want of knowing my ſelfe. For if I knew my ſelfe well, and held myſelfe for the worſt of the company, and looked vpon euery other man as if he were my ſuperiour, I ſhould not be ſoe bould, as to hould ſuch language to them. If you aske from whence grow thoſe excuſes, and thoſe complaints and thoſe murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, as <hi>why they doe not giue me this or
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7498:55"/>
that,</hi> or <hi>why they treate me in ſuch a fashion,</hi> it is cleere that it riſes from the ſame roote. If you aske from whence it comes, that a man is ſoe much troubled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, when he findes himſelfe moleſted, by varietie of temptations; or growes melancholy, and is diſcouraged, when he falls often into any defect; this alſoe growes from want of a mans knowinge himſelfe. For if you were truly humble, and conſidered well the malice of your harts, you would not be troubled or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid at this, but you would rather be in wounder, that you committ noe worſe things how you came not to haue more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous faults; and you would be giuing great thanks, and prayſe to God, for houldeing you ſoe faſt in his hand, that ſoo you fall not into thoſe things, into which infallibly you would haue fallne, if he had not held you vp. For, from a very ſource, and ſincke of vice, what ſinne is that which would not flowe? From ſuch a filthy dunghill what ſhould we expect, but an odious and abominable ſtincke, and from ſuch a tree, ſuch fruite. Wpon thoſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordatus eſt quoniam puluis ſummus; Hee remembreth that we are but duſt, S. Anſelme</hi>

ſaith, <hi>what wonder is it, if duſt be blowne away by winde.</hi> If alſoe you deſire a meanes whereby you may come to ſhew much Charitie towards your brethren, and that you may be obedient, and patient, and very penitent, you may heere finde the remedy of all.</p>
               <p>Wee reade of our Father <hi>Franciſcus de Borgia,</hi> that being once in iourney, he was mett by a great lord of theis kingdomes, whoe was a freind of his, and when he obſerued him to be ſoe full of pouertie and incommodity, he was hartily ſorry to ſee it, and beſought him to be more carefull of his perſon, and to cheriſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The Father, with a cheerfull countinance, and much quietnes, ſaid thus to him; <hi>I beſeech your Lordship not to be troubled concerning me, and thinke not that I goe ſoe ill prouided as you haue conceiued.

               <p>IT will appeare by what is ſaid, how much it concernes vs to be exerciſed in <hi>the knowledge of our ſelues. Thales Mileſius,</hi> one of the ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wiſe men of <hi>Greece,</hi> being asked which, of all naturall things, was the hardeſt to be knowne, made this anſwere, <hi>Amans ſelfe.</hi> Becauſe the loue which a man beares himſelfe, is ſoe great, that it diſtracts, and hinders this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and from hence grew that ſaying, which was ſoe much celebrated amongſt the auntie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, <hi>Noſce te ipsu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> know thy ſelfe.

The B.

Men,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine, are wont
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7498:57"/>
to eſteeme much the knowledge of the heauens, and of the earth by Aſtrologie, and Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie, and to knowe the motions of the skye, and the courſe of the planetts. With their proprieties, and influences; but yet the knowledge of a mans ſelfe, is the moſt high, and profitable ſcience of them all. Other ſciences blow a man and puffe him vp,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith; <hi>but wee are humbled and edified by this.</hi> And ſoe the Saints, and all Maiſters of ſpiritt, doe greatly charge vs, to employ our ſelues in prayer, vpon this exerciſe: and they reproue the errour of ſome, who paſſe too lightly ouer the conſideration of their owne defects, and detaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in thinking vpon other deuout things, becauſe they finde guſt in them; but none, in the conſideration of their defects and faults; becauſe they take noe pleaſure in looking into them ſelues; and in this they are like ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, who becauſe they are ſoe, dare not looke vpon themſelues in a glaſſe.</p>
               <p>The glorious Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaking to man, in the perſon of God, ſaith thus: <hi>O homo ſi te videres, tibi diſpliceres, &amp; mihi placeres: ſed quia te non vides, tibi places, &amp; mihi diſplices. O man, if thou didſt ſee, and know thy ſelfe, thou wouldſt be diſpleaſing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7498:57"/>
to thy ſelfe, and thou wouldſt be pleaſing to mee: but now becauſe thou doeſt not ſee, and know thy ſelfe, thou art pleaſing to thy ſelfe, and art diſpleaſing to me. Veniet tempus cum nec mihi nec tibi placebis, mihi quia peccaſti, tibi quia in aeternum ardebis. Take heede that there come not once a tyme when thou shall neither be pleaſing to God, nor to thy ſelfe, not to God, becauſe thou haſt ſinned, nor to thy ſelfe, becauſe thou art damned by thy ſelfe, through thine owne fault.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> treating of this, ſaith, there are ſome whoe as ſoone as they beginne to ſerue God, and to take vertue a litle into their conſideration, thinke preſently, that they are holy and good; and doe ſoe place their eyes vpon the good they doe, that they forgett their miſeries and ſinnes paſt, yea and ſomety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes their preſent ſinnes too; for they are ſoe very buſy about gazing vpon the good they doe, that they attend not, nay and ſee not, the ill which ſometymes they committ. But ſuch as indeede are good, and the elect of God, proceede after a very different manner. For where as indeede they are full of vertue and good works they are yet euer looking vpon the ill they doe, and are conſidering
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7498:58"/>
and ruminating vpon their imperfections &amp; defects. And we ſhall quickly ſee what becomes of both theis kindes of men. For they whoe are moſt conſidering their ſinnes, ſecure their good deedes, and conſerue the great vertues which they poſſeſſe, remayneing euer in humilitie; and on the contrary ſide, thoſe others, whoe are looking ſoe earneſtly vpon their good deedes, looſe them, becauſe they growe vaine and proud thereof. So that good men ſerue themſelues of their very ſinnes, and draw good &amp; ſpirituall profitt from thence; whereas ill men draw hurt and loſſe, euen from their good deedes, becauſe they make ill vſe thereof. As it happens in the caſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall food, which, though in it ſelfe it be healthfull &amp; good, yet if a man eate of it without rule or meaſure, it will make him ſicke. And ſoe on the other ſide, if the very poyſon of vipers be taken, with a certaine compoſition, &amp; propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will become a Treacle, and giue him health. When therefore they ſhall bring the good things which you haue done to your memory, to the end that you may eſteeme and value your ſelfe. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> aduiſes you, to oppoſe your
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7498:58"/>
ill deedes againſt them and to call your former ſinnes to minde. So did S. Paule, to the end that his great vertues might not blowe him vp, as alſoe his hauing benne rapt, into the third heauen, and made capable of thoſe high reuelations, which were imparted to him. <hi>Quia prius blaſphemus fui, &amp; perſecutor, &amp; contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioſus.</hi> Alas ſaith hee, <hi>I haue bene a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemour, and a perſecutor of the ſeruants of God, and of the name of Chriſt; alas I am not worthie to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I haue perſecuted the Church of God. Qui non ſum dignus vocari Apoſtolus, quoniam perſecutus ſum eccleſiam Dei.</hi> This is a very good counterpoiſe, and a very good countermine, againſt this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Vpon thoſe words, which the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changell <hi>Gabriell</hi> ſpake to the Prophet <hi>Daniell, Intellige fili hominis, O ſonne of man obſerue, what I intend to ſay to the, S. Hierome</hi> ſaith, that thoſe holy Prophetts Daniell, Ezechiell, &amp; Zacharias, through the high &amp; continuall reuelations, which they had, ſeemed already, as it were, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe amongſt the Quires of Angells; and to the end that they might not exalt them ſelues aboue them ſelues, and grow idle
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7498:59"/>
headed, and proud, vpon that occaſion, as conceiuing that they were growne to be of a kinde of Superiour &amp; Angelicall nature, the Angell letts them know on the part of God, that they muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their humaine nature and frailty; &amp; he calls them <hi>ſonnes of men,</hi> that ſoe they might vnderſtand them ſelues to be fraile men, and miſerable creatures like the reſt; and that ſoe they might be humble, and eſteeme them ſelues but as they were. And wee haue many examples in hiſtories both Eccleſiaſticall and prophane, both of Saints and other illuſtrious perſons, kings, Emperours and Prelates, who vſed this meanes; and euer kept ſome about them, whoe might bring them to remembrance from tyme to tyme, that they were but men; ſoe to conſerue them in Humilitie, and to keepe them from growing vayne and proud.</p>
               <p>It is recounted of our <hi>Father Franciſcus Borgia,</hi> that whilſt he was yet Duke of <hi>Caudia,</hi> a holy man gaue him this councell, that if hee had a minde to profitt much in the ſeruice of God, no day might paſſe, wherein he would not thinke ſeriouſly of ſomwhat, which might putt him to confuſion, and meane
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7498:59"/>
opinion of himſelfe. And he tooke this Counſell ſoe much to hart, that from the tyme that he vſed the exerciſe of Mentall Prayer, he imployed euery day, the two firſt howers there of, vpon this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; contempt of himſelfe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, what ſoeuer he heard, and read, &amp; ſaw, it all ſerued him towards this aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing &amp; confuſion. And beſides he had another Deuotion which helped him much, and it was, that euery day as ſoone as he roſe, he kiſſed the ground three tymes, to put him in minde, that he was duſt and earth, and that into earth he muſt returne. And it well appeers how much profitt he drew from thence, by the great example of Humilitie and ſanctitie, which he left behinde him. Lett vs therefore obſerue this Councell, and practiſe it. Lett no one day paſſe, wherein we ſpend not ſome tyme of prayer, and conſider not ſomewhat which may tend to our confuſion and contempt: and lett vs not grow weary, nor giue ouer this exerciſe, till we finde that our ſoule hath euen drunke vp, a profound &amp; cordiall deſire to be diſeſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and deſpiſed: and till we may feele our ſelues to be greately aſhamed, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7498:60"/>
with ſoe much baſenes and miſery as ours is, before the high preſence and Maieſtie of Almightie God.</p>
               <p>We haue very much neede of all this; for our pride and inclination to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, and eſteemed, is ſoe very great, that if we walke not contynually in this exerciſe, we ſhall finde our ſelues euery hower to be lifted vp aboue our ſelues, as corke goes ſwyming vpon the water, for noe corke is ſoe light and vaine as wee. Wee muſt euer be repreſſing and beating downe that ſwelling and pride which heaues vs vp, and we muſt looke towards the feete of our deformity and baſenes, that ſoe the wheele of our vanitie and pride may be broken in peeces. Lett vs remember the <hi>Parable,</hi> of the <hi>Figg tree,</hi> which is mentioned in the holy Ghoſpell and which the owner thereof had a minde to pluck vp by the rootes; becauſe in three yeares, it had borne noe fruite; but the gardner moued that it might be ſuffered to grow a yeare longer, and ſaid that he would digg about it, and that if then, it gaue not fruite it might afterwards be rooted vp. Digge you, in like manner, about the dry and barraine figg tree of your ſowles, and lett the dunge and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7498:60"/>
of your ſinnes be caſt round about it ſince you haue ſuch ſtore thereof, and ſoe you ſhall be alſo fertile, and beare fruite.</p>
               <p>To the end that we may be the more animated to vſe this exerciſe, and that noe man take ocaſion to giue it ouer, through any vaine apprehenſions, We are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand two things. The firſt, that no man muſt thinke that this exerciſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs onely to <hi>beginners,</hi> becauſe it alſoe concernes <hi>Proficients,</hi> and moſt <hi>Perfect</hi> men; ſince we ſee that they, and euen S. Paule himſelfe did vſe it. In the ſecond place, it is fitt for vs to vnderſtand, that this exerciſe is no afflictiue or melancholy kinde of thing, nor cauſes trouble or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, but rather brings with it greate peace and reſt, yea and great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment and ioy, for any man to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider &amp; knowe himſelfe, how many defects and faults ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee committ, &amp; how perfectly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he vnderſtand, that becauſe he is ſoe wicked he deſerues that all men ſhould deſpiſe and hate him. For when this knowledge of our ſelues growes from true <hi>Humilitie,</hi> that paine comes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſuch a kinde of ſwauitie, and contentment, that a man would be ſorry to be with out it. Other paines and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7498:61"/>
which ſome feele, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their faults and imperfections, are temptations of the diuell, whoe, on the one ſide, procures by this meanes, to make vs thinke that we are truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and, on the other, would be content to make vs diſtruct the goodnes of God, and to be diſhartned, and diſmayed in his ſeruice. Indeede if we were ſtill to pawſe vpon the knowledge of our owne miſery and weakenes, we ſhould haue occaſion enough to be afflicted and ſadd, yea and to be diſcouraged and diſmayed; but wee muſt not ſtay there, but paſſe on to the conſideration of the goodnes, and mercy, and liberalitie of God, and how much hee loues vs, and what hee ſuffered for vs, and in this are we to place all our hope. And ſoe, that which would be an occaſion of diſmay and ſorrow, by looking vpon our ſelues, ſerues to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and incourage vs, and is an occaſion of greater comfort and ioy when wee lift vp our eyes towards God. A man behoulds himſelfe, and ſees nothing but cauſe of greife, but looking vp to God, he confides in his goodnes without feare of being forſaken, notwithſtanding the many faults, and imperfections, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7498:61"/>
miſeryes, which hee diſcernes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For the goodnes and mercy of God, vpon which hee hath placed his eyes and his hart, doth infinitely exceede and outſtripp all that which can be ill in vs. And with this conſideration, being rooted in the very ſtrings of the harte, a man vntyes himſelfe from himſelfe, as from ſome broken reede, and euer goes reſting vpon God, and confiding in him according vnto that of the Prophett <hi>Daniel. Neque enim in iuſtificationibus noſtris proſternimus preces ante faciem tuam, ſed in miſerationibus tuis multis. Not confiding in our ſelues, nor in any meritts or good worke of ours, doe we preſume to lift vp our eyes to thee O Lord, and to begg fauour at thy hands but by putting our confidence in thy greate mercy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Caſsianus</hi> recounts, that a certaine Monck came once to viſit the Abbot <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupion,</hi> who in habitt, ieſture, and words, ſeemed to be of great <hi>Humility,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of himſelfe; and neuer made an end of ſpeaking ill of himſelfe, and of ſaying that he was ſoe great a ſinner, and ſoe wicked a man, that he was not worthy to breath in the common ayre, nor to tread vpon the earth, and much leſſe would he conſent that they ſhould waſh his feete. The Abbot <hi>Serapion,</hi> after he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7498:63"/>
had dyned, began to treate of ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, as he had bene accuſtomed, and applied alſoe ſome little thing to his gueſt, and gaue him this good aduice with greate mildnes and loue; Namely, that ſince he was yonge an ſtronge, he ſhould procure to remaine in his Cell, and labour with his hands for his foode, according to the rule of the Moncks and not tot goe idly vp &amp; downe by the Cells of others. This Moncke was ſo much troubled at this admonition and aduice, that he could not poſſibly diſemble it, but ſhewed it euidently by his countenance. Then ſaid the Abbot <hi>Serapion,</hi> what is this my ſonne, that till now, you haue bene ſpeaking ſoe much ill of your ſelfe, &amp; ſoe many things of diſhonor and affront to you; and that now, vpon an admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſoe eaſy as this which containes noe iniury or affront at all, but rather much loue and Charitie, you haue bene ſoe much offended and altered, that you could not hide it. Did you hope perhaps, by meanes of that ill which you ſaid of your ſelfe: to heare that ſentence of the wiſe man out of our mouth, <hi>Iuſtus prior eſt accuſator ſui. This man is iuſt and humble, ſince he ſpeakes ill of himſelfe?</hi> Did you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7498:63"/>
that wee ſhould prayſe you, and hould you for a Saint. Ah, ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> how many tymes is this! that very thing, to which we pretend by our hypocriſies, and counterfeit <hi>Humilities?</hi> but that which would faine ſeeme <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,</hi> is great pride. For we humble our ſelues many tymes, to the end that we may be prayſed by men, and be held for humble and good. And if you will not graunte me this; I muſt aske you why you ſay that of your ſelfe, which you will not haue others to beleeue? If you ſpeake it from your hart, and if you walke in the way of truth, you muſt deſire that others may beleeue it too, and may hould you for ſuch as you ſaid; and if you deſire not this, you ſhew plainely that you pretend not thereby to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, but to be valued and eſteemed. This is that, which the wiſeman ſaith: <hi>Eſt qui ne quiter humiliat ſe, &amp; interiora eius plena ſunt dolo. There are ſome whoe humble them ſelues, after a counterfeit manner, and their hart is full of deceipt and pride.</hi> For what greater deceipt can there be, then by meanes of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> to be honored and eſteemed by men; and what greater pride, then to pretend to be held humble?

to tell him his faultes: But to what end ſerue theſe hypocriſies, &amp; fictions: for you beleeue not that there were any faults, nor pretend any other thing, but that he ſhould praiſe your ſermon, and that he ſhould iumpe with your owne opinion; and that, is indeede the thinge, which you are glad to heere; For if by accident, he tell you plainely of any fault, you are not pleaſed; but rather you will defend it, &amp; ſometymes it happens, that you will iudge him who told you of it; as not hauing ſoe good an vnderſtanding, and note in things of that nature, becauſe he held that for a fault, which you conceiue to haue bene well ſaid. All this is pride, and deſire of prayſe, which you pretend to ſatisfie, by this counterfeit <hi>Humilitie.</hi> At other tymes, when wee are not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the faulte, we confeſſe it very cleerely, to the end, that ſince we haue loſt a pointe of honour by making the fault, we may recouer it againe by confeſſing it after an humble manner. At other tymes, ſaith <hi>Saint Bonauenture,</hi> we exaggerate our owne faults, and ſay more then is true, to the end that others ſeeing that it is neyther poſſible, nor

By a thowſand deuiſes and tricks doe we procure to hide and diſguiſe our pride vnder the Cloake of <hi>Humilitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus, by the way, you ſhall ſee, as <hi>Saint Bernard</hi> ſaith, how pretious a thing <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and how baſe and hatefull, pride is. <hi>Glorioſa res humilitas, qua ipſa quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſuperbia palliare ſe appetit, ne vileſcat. See how ſublime and glorious a thing humilitie is, ſince euen pride deſires to ſerue it ſelfe thereof, and to be cloaked therewith; and ſee alſoe how baſe and shamefull a thing pride is, ſince it dares not ſoe much as appeere with the face diſcouered; but ouer shadowed and deſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by the veyle of humilitie.</hi> For you would be extreamely aſhamed, &amp; hould your ſelfe for greately affronted, if the other ſhould vnderſtand that you pretend and deſire to be eſteemed, and prayſed: &amp; therefore it is, that you procure to couer your pride, with the apparance of <hi>Hmili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:7498:66"/>
But now, why will you indeede be that, which you are ſoe aſhamed to ſeeme to be. If you would be ſoe out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that others ſhould knowe, you deſire to be eſteemed, and prayſed, why are you not much more aſhamed, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it. For the defect and ill thereof, conſiſts in the act it ſelfe of your deſiring it, and not in their knowing that you deſire it. And if you be aſhamed that men ſhould know it; why are you not aſhamed, that it ſhould be ſeene, &amp; knowne, by Almightie God. <hi>Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum meum viderunt oculi tui.

               </argument>
               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>IN reguard that this ſecond degree of Humilitie is the moſt practicall, and difficult part of the exerciſe of this vertue, we will deuide it, as ſome of the Saints haue done: and wee will ſett forth fower degrees or ſtepps thereof; that ſoe by little and little, and as it were by meaſured paces, wee may goe riſing vp to that perfection of Humility, which this ſecond degree exacts. The firſt ſteppe is, not to deſire to be honored, or eſteemed by men, but rather to flye from all that, which hath any touch of honor and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Our bookes are full of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Saints, whoe were ſoe very farr from deſiring to be eſteemed or honored by the world, as that they fledd from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7498:68"/>
and dignities, and from all thoſe occaſions which might bring eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them in the ſight of men, as from the moſt capitall enemy which they could haue. Chriſt, our Redeemer, and our Maſter, gaue vs the firſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this, when hee fledd vpon his notice, that they ment to chooſe him for their king; after that illuſtrious miracle of hauing fedd fiue thowſand men, with fiue loaues, and two fiſhes; when yet himſelfe, ranne noe hazard in any ſtate of life, how high ſoeuer it might be, but onely to giue vs exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And for the ſelfe ſame reaſon, when he was pleaſed to manifeſt the glory of his moſt ſacred body, to his three diſciples, in his admirable Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, he commaunded them not to ſpeake of it, to any, till after his death, and glorious Reſurrection. And giuing ſight to thoſe blinde men, and working of other miracles, he comaunded them to be ſilent. And all this was done to giue vs an example of flying from honour, and the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, in regard of our great danger to grow vaine, and ſoe to periſh thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:7498:69"/>In the Cronicles of the Order of <hi>Bleſſed Saint Francis,</hi> it is recounted, that brother <hi>Giles</hi> hearing the relation of the fall of brother <hi>Elias,</hi> who had bene their <hi>Generall,</hi> and a great learned man, and who was then an Apoſtata, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for applying himſelfe to the Emperour Frederike the ſecond, whoe had reuoulted from the Church, brother <hi>Giles</hi> hearing this, caſt himſelfe downe to the ground, and embraced it as ſtreightly as he could, and being asked why he did ſoe, he made this anſwere. <hi>I will gett as farre downe as I can, for that other fell downe, becauſe he would needes riſe vp ſoe high. Gerſon</hi> brings that to this purpoſe, which the Poets faine of the Giant <hi>Antheus</hi> ſonne of the Earth: Who fighting with <hi>Hercules,</hi> recouered new ſtrength, euery tyme that he was caſt downe to the ground, and ſoe he could not be ouercome; but <hi>Hercules</hi> obſeruing this, lifted him vp on high, and ſoe cutt off his head. This ſaith <hi>Gerſon,</hi> doth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell pretend to doe with vs. Hee ſeekes to hoyſe vs vpp with honour, eſtimation and praiſe, that ſoe hee
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7498:69"/>
may cutt our throates, and then caſt vs downe more low, then we roſe high. And therefore the true humble man, caſts himſelfe downe to the earth, of the knowledge of himſelfe, and feares, and flyes from being puffed vp, and prayſed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree, as Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmus</hi> ſaith, is this, <hi>Vt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We doe not ſay in this place, that you ſhould deſire iniuries and affronts, and that you ſhould goe in ſearch thereof, and reioyce therein, when you finde them. That pointe is more high, and perfect, and heerafter wee ſhall treate thereof; but that which now wee ſay, is, that when any thing ſhall preſent it ſelfe, which may ſeeme to pointe at your diſaduantage, you beate it at leaſt with patience, if you cannot doe it with ioy. According to that of the wiſe man, <hi>Omne quod tibi applicatum fuerit, accipe, &amp; in dolore ſuſtine, &amp; in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7498:70"/>
humilitate tua patientiam habe. All that which offers it ſelfe, contrary to your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality and guſt, receiue it in good part though it trouble you and ſuffer it with Humilitie and patience.</hi> This is a greate meanes, both for the obteyning of Humility, and preſeruing it. For, as honor and the eſtimation of men, is a meanes to make vs proud and vayne, and therefore did the Saints fly ſoe farr from it, ſoe all that which tends to our diſeſtimation and contempt, is a very great meanes, both for the getting of Humilitie, and growing in it. Saint <hi>Laurentius Iuſtinianus,</hi> was wont to ſay, that Humilitie is like a ſtreame or brooke, which in winter carries much water, and little in Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, and ſoe Humilitie growes leſſe and leſſe in proſperitie, and greater in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie.</p>
               <p>Many are the occaſions, and they are offered vs daylie, for the exerciſe of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, if we would vſe attention and care in profiting thereby. That Saint ſaith thus very well. That which pleaſes others ſhall be effected, that which contents thee ſhall not be done: that which others ſay ſhall be eſteemed, that which thou ſaith, ſhall ſtand for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7498:70"/>
Others ſhall aske and receiue, thou ſhalt begg and ſhalt not obtaine, others ſhalbe greate in the mouthes of men; and ſhall make noe account of thee: and affaires ſhalbe communicated to others, and thou ſhalt be held vnfitt for them. Let euery man take account of himſelfe, and goe diſcourſing of thoſe particular occaſions, which may, or vſe to offer themſelues, and obſerue how he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes therein. Obſerue how you like it, when another commaunds you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and after an imperious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Obſerue how you take it, when they admoniſh you or reproue you for any faulte. Obſerue what you thinke, when you conceiue that your Superiour deales not confidently, but lookes vpon you with a kinde of wary or iealous eye. Saint <hi>Dorotheus</hi> aduiſes, that when ſoeuer any of theis occaſions is offered vs, to receiue it as a remedy, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine wherewith to cure and heale our pride; and to praye God for him who miniſters the occaſion, as for the <hi>Phiſition</hi> of our ſoules, and to be fully perſwaded that who ſoeuer abhorrs theis things, abhors Humilitie.</p>
               <p>

But he, who hearing his prayſes takes occaſion from thence to be the more confounded and humbled, is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Siluer and gould, becauſe that fire of prayſe did not conſume it: but rather it remayned more purified and perfected thereby, ſince the man was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and humbled.</p>

ſui. The man who is truly humble, deſireth to be held by others, in ſmall accounte, and not to be accounted humble, but vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and meane, and to be glad thereof.</hi> This is the ſecond degree of Humilitie, and in this the perfection thereof conſiſts. And for this reaſon, <hi>Humilitie</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Narde</hi> which is a ſmalle and odoriferous hearbe, according to that of the Canticles. <hi>Nardus mea dedit odorem ſuum.</hi> For then dot the Odour of this <hi>Narde</hi> of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> extend and impart it ſelfe to others, when not onely you put little eſteeme vpon your ſelfe, but when you alſoe deſire, and like well, that you be deſpiſed and diſeſteemed by others. <hi>Saint Bernard</hi> notes, that there are two kindes of <hi>Humilitie.</hi> One is when a man conſidering himſelfe, and perceiuing his miſery, and baſenes, is conuinced by the truth, and houlds himſelfe in noe eſteeme and reſolues that he is worthy to be deſpiſed and diſhonoured by all men. Hee ſaith, that the former Humilitie, namely that of the vnderſtanding, was not in Chriſt our Lord; for it was not poſſible for him to thinke, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to be held in meane accounte, and much leſſe to be diſhonored, and deſpiſed.

For in reguard of the great loue which he bore vs, he was pleaſed to abaſe and diſauthoriſe himſelfe; and to ſeeme vile and contemptible in the eyes of men. And ſoe he ſaith, <hi>Diſcite a me, quia mitis ſum &amp; humilis corde. Learne of me, for I am meeke and humble of hart.</hi> But as for vs, wee are to haue both theis <hi>Humilities,</hi> becauſe the firſt with out the ſecond, is deceipt full &amp; falſe. To deſire to ſeeme, and to be held for other, then that which really you are, is falſhood &amp; deceipt. Hee whoe really is humble, and indeede thinks baſely and diſeſteemes and deſpiſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, is alſoe to be gladd, that others may deſpiſe and diſeſteeme him.</p>
               <p>This is that which we are to learne of Chriſt our Lord. Conſider how cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially and with how ardent deſire, and will, he embraced diſhonour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for loue of vs. For he was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, with abaſing and emptying
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7498:74"/>
himſelfe, by making himſelfe man, and takeing the forme of a ſeruant vpon him, he who was &amp; is the lord of heauen and earth; but he would needes aſſume the forme and habit of a ſinner. <hi>Deus filium ſuum mittens in ſimilitudine carnis peccati,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>God ſent his ſonne, in the habit and ſimilitude of a ſinfull man.</hi> Hee tooke not ſinn, becauſe ſinne could not be in him, but he tooke the marke and ſigne of ſinners, for he would be circumcized as a ſinner, and baptiſed amongſt Publicans and ſinners; as if he had bene one of them, and would be leſſe eſteemed then <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas,</hi> and iudged to be a worſe man, and more vnworthie of life, then hee. To conclude, the deſire which he had to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, affronts, and ſcornes, and reproach, for loue of vs, was ſoe very greate, that he thought the hower to ſtay very longe, wherein, all inebrated with loue, he might remaine naked, like another <hi>Noe,</hi> to be ſcorned by men. <hi>Baptiſme habeo baptizari, &amp; quomodo coarcto donec perficiatur. With baptiſme</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>am I to be baptiſed</hi> (which was a baptiſme of blood) <hi>and how am I in paine, till I may be able to put it in execution.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7498:75"/>
that the hower may once arriue, wherein there shall be nothing for me, but buffitts, and ſpurns as to any ſlaue.</hi> For he knew that they would ſpitt vpon his face, as a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and cloath him with white as a foole, and with purple as a Counterfeit king, and aboue all that they would loade him with ſcourges. Which was the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Malefactors and murdering theeues; and finally with the torment of the Croſſe in the company of murderers; which then was the moſt ignominious and reproach full manner of death, that could be ſound in the world. This is that, which Chriſt our redeemer deſired, with ſoe great deſire. <hi>Improperium expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctauit cor meum, &amp; miſeriam,</hi> ſaith the Prophet in his name. <hi>I was expecting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and affronts, as one would expect ſome what which were very pleaſing to him, and were to giue him much guſt;</hi> For indeede of ſuch things as theis, ought we to haue hope, and greife, for our feare of others. And the Prophett <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turabitur opprobriis.</hi> Hee deſired and thirſted after this hower, that he might as a man may ſay, euen haue his bellyfull of reproches, and affronts, and ſcornes, as of things to which he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7498:75"/>
carryed an extreame appetite, and of which hee was very greedy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede they were moſt ſauory to him for the loue of vs.</p>
               <p>But now if the ſonne of God, deſired diſhonor and contempt, with ſoe greate appetite, and receiued them with ſoe much contentment and guſt for the loue of vs, hee hauinge noe way deſerued them; mee thinks it ſhould be no ſuch ſtrange matter for vs, who haue ſoe well deſerued all kinde of diſhonour and contempt, to deſire for loue of him, to bee held for noe other then what we are, and to reioyce in ſuffering thoſe diſgraces and affronts which wee deſerue; as Saint Paule did when he ſaid; <hi>Propter quod, placeo mihi in infirmitatibus meis, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelijs, in neceſsitatibus, in anguſtiis pro Christo.</hi> For which reaſon I reioyce in my infirmities, and iniuries: &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, &amp; neceſſities, &amp; perſecutions and all kinde of difficulties, for Chriſt our Lord. And wryting to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> and treating of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>he deſires them to beare him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in the ioy he had, to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Chaines, for Christ our Lord.</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:7498:76"/>
Hee had ſuch an abundance of ioy in the perſecutions and afflictions which hee ſuffered, that hee had to ſpare for his freinds, and therefore he inuited them to pertake thereof, with him. This is that milke, which the Bleſſed Apoſtles ſuckt from the breſt of Chriſt. And ſoe wee read thus of them; <hi>Ibant gaudentes a conſpectu concilii, quoniam digni habiti ſunt pro nomine Ieſu, contumeliam pati. They were full of ioy and guſt, when they were carried priſoners, before their preſidents, and into their Sinagogues, and eſteemed it for a great fauour, &amp; regalo, at the hands of God, to be thouht worthy to ſuffer affronts, and iniuries, for the name of Chriſt.</hi> Heerein they were imitated by other Saints, as, for example by a Saint <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, whoe when they were carrying him to be martyred at <hi>Rome,</hi> with many ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and reproaches, was full of ioy and ſaid: <hi>Nunc incipio Chriſti eſſe diſcipulus. It is but now, that I begin to be a Diſciple of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is that which our <hi>Father</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that we may imitate, and he inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it in theis words, of great exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; ponderation. <hi>They who shall enter heere, &amp; liue in the Society, are to obſerue and conſider, as in the preſence of God, our

Creatour and our Lord, that it is of great moment, and must be with vs of greate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counte, in order to our profiting in the way of ſpiritt; to abhorre wholly, and not onely in parte, whatſoeuer the world embraces and loues; and to embrace with our whole harts, whatſoeuer was embraced by Chriſt our Lord. For as worldly men follow, and loue the world, and with all diligence ſearch after worldly honour, and estimation, and fame, as the world teaches them, ſo they whoe walke in ſpiritt and are ſerious in following Christ our Lord, doe ardently deſire the direct contrary. That is to ſay, the ſame cloathing, and liuery, which our Lord ware for the loue and reuerence which we beare him. And all this to ſuch a proportion, as that where ſoeuer it may not be of any offence to his diuine Maiestie, nor involue the ſinne of any of our neighbours, nor our ſelues giue any occaſion thereof, we muſt deſire to ſuffer iniuries, falſe teſtimonies, affronts, and to be esteemed for noe better then fooles, and this onely, through a deſire to imitate &amp; reſemble Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, and creatour, in ſome poore manner.</hi> In this <hi>Rule</hi> is decyphred all that which can be ſaid of Humility. This is to haue, in good earneſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken and deteſted the world, and the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7498:77"/>
moſt difficult parte thereof, which is the appetite and deſire to bee valued, and eſteemed, this is to be dead to the world, and to be indeede Religious; that as they of the world, deſire to be honoured and eſteemed, and reioyce in it, ſo we may deſire diſhonour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and be glad of them. This is to be truly of <hi>the Society</hi> of <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and to be the companions of <hi>Ieſus.</hi> Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keepe him company, not onely in name but in diſhonor, and contempt; and lett vs put on his liuery, in being affronted and deſpiſed by the world, with him, and for him; and in being ioyfull, and glad thereof for his loue.

was taught, doth well towards his learninge to play; but with all, it is a ſigne that as yet, he hath not gotten the habitt of that inſtrument, For he who hath gott it, needes not call this, or that to minde, to the end that he may play well. And ſoe ſaid <hi>Ariſtotle Ars perfecta, non deliberat, tam ſibi facilis eſt actus ſuus. Hee whoe hath perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the habit of any art, findes it ſoe eaſy to performe the acts thereof, that he hath noe neede of cogitation or deliberation, how to doe them, for the doeing the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> well.</hi> And ſoe the Philoſophers come to ſay, <hi>that the vertue of a man is knowne, by his ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and inconſiderate acts. In repentinis ſecundum habitum operamur;</hi> a mans vertue is not knowne by the acts which he performeth, vpon great deliberation, but by ſuch, as doe come from him, at vnawares.</p>
               <p>Yea and the Philoſophers ſay yet more then this. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> treating how it may be knowne, when a man hath obteyned a vertue giues <hi>two</hi> ſignes the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof; and one of them which the greate Philoſopher <hi>Zeno</hi> left in wryting, is, by his <hi>Dreames.</hi> If euen when you are in your dreames, as you are ſleeping,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7498:79"/>
you haue noe ill impulſes or vncleane imaginations; or when, if you haue them, you take noe guſt or contentment in them, but the contrary: and when you reſiſt the temptation and delight thereof euen in your dreames, as if you were a wake, this is a ſigne, that the vertue is well rooted in your ſoules, and that, not onely your vill is ſubiect to reaſon, but euen your ſenſuall appetite, and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Iuſt ſoe, as when Coach-horſes are well taught, though the Coachman lay the raines on their necks, &amp; perhaps ſleepe himſelfe, yet they goe on their way, without making any fault. Soe, ſaith the Philoſopher: They whoe haue perfectly obteyned any vertue, and haue totally ſubdued the affects and brutall appetites which repugne to it, goe on their, right way, euen when they ſleepe. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth alſo teach vs this doctrine, thus. <hi>Domine, memores man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datorum tuorum, etiam in ſomnis reſiſtimus.</hi> Some ſeruants of God carry ſoe greate an affection to vertue, and to the keeping of God's comaundements, and ſoe great deteſtation againſt vice, and are ſoe accuſtomed, and inured to the reſiſtance of temptations, when they are a wake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:7498:79"/>
as that they reſiſt them alſoe euen when they ſleepe. Wee read in the life of <hi>Father Franciſcus Xauier,</hi> that in a certaine tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation or illuſion which he had once in his ſleepe, caſt vp certaine gulpes of bloud. In this ſorte doe ſome declare, that place of Sainct <hi>Paule: Siue vigelemus, ſiue dormiamus, ſimul cùm illo viuamus:</hi> which imports onely that both liuing and dying, wee muſt euer liue vith Chriſt vhich is the common expoſition: but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer that the zealous ſeruants of God, muſt euer liue with Chriſt, and that not onely wakeing, but euen ſleeping alſo, &amp; dreameing.</p>
               <p>The Philoſophers goe yet further, and ſay; that the third condition or ſigne, whereby it may be knowne, if a man haue perfectly obteyned any vertue, is when he performes the workes thereof, <hi>Delectabiliter,</hi> with <hi>delight and guſt,</hi> for this is the principall ſigne, wherein the perfection of vertue conſiſts. If therefore you wil ſee whether you haue obteyned the perfection of the vertue of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> examine your ſelues by that rule, which we deliuered in the laſt Chapter; and ſee whether you be as gladd of any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and affront, as wordly men vſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7498:80"/>
to be, of honour and eſtimation.</p>
               <p>But beſides that all this is neceſſary for arriueing to the perfection of any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, there is yet another thing of very greate importance, towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynuing, and perſeuering therein. For in fine, till wee arriue to performe the actions of vertue, with guſt and ioy, it will be a thing of much difficultie, to continue in vertue. Saint <hi>Dorotheus</hi> ſaith, that this was the common doctrine of thoſe antient fathers: <hi>Solebant patres, &amp; maiores nostri, firmiter aſſerere; Quicquid animus alacriter non admittit, diuturnum eſſe non poſſe. Thoſe antient Fathers were wont to ſay, and they held it for a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth, that whatſoeuer was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with gust and ioy, could not laſt any long tyme.</hi> It may well happen, that for ſome fitt, you will keepe ſilence, and liue with modeſty and recollection; but yet, till this flow from the very inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of the hart, and till by the good cuſtome which you vſe, you make it growe as it were to be connaturall to you, and ſoe you come to performe it with ſwauitie and guſt, you will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynue longe therein, but it will paſſe, as being affectect and forced; <hi>Et nullum vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentum
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7498:80"/>
perpetuum.</hi> For this reaſon, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſoe much, to exerciſe the acts of any vertue with ſuch conſtancy, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to roote it in the ſoule, which muſt euen drinke it vp in ſuch ſort, that it may fall, euen as it were of it ſelfe, vpon the vertue and they may ſeeme to be acts of our owne nature, for ſoe wee ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them with ioy and guſt. By theſe meanes we may obtaine a kinde of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that we ſhall contynue and perſeuer therein. This is that, which the Prophett ſaith: <hi>Sed in lege domini volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tas eius.</hi> Another tranſlation ſaith, <hi>Sed in lege Domini voluptas eius.</hi> Bleſſed is that man, whoſe whole contentment, ioy, and gladnes, is in the law of our lord, and whoe make it his delights, and entertainements; for that man will yeild the fruite of good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, like a tree which is planted by the riuer ſide.</p>

               <p>SAint <hi>Iohn Climaeus</hi> adds another poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te to the former; and ſaith that as proud men loue honour and eſtimation, ſoe much, that to be the more honoured, and eſteemed by men, they faine, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſometymes to certaine things, which they haue not, as namely more nobilitie, more riches, more capacitie, and parts then their owne; ſoe it is the ſigne of a moſt profound <hi>Humility,</hi> when a man arriues to haue ſoe greate a deſire to be humbled, and deſpiſed, that for the obteyning thereof, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures in certaine caſes, to faigne, and to pretend to haue ſome defects, which indeede he hath noth; that ſoe hee may come to be leſſe eſteemed. Of this, ſaith hee, we haue an example in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7498:81"/>
father Simeon; whoe, hearing that the Admirall of the Country, came to make him a viſitt, as to a famous and holy man, tooke a peece of bread and cheeſe into his hand, and ſitting downe at the doore of his Cell, hee began to eate thereof after ſuch an vntoward manner, as ſome naturall foole might vſe, which as ſoone as the Admirall ſaw, hee deſpiſed him; and the other remained with much contentment, for hauing obteyned what he pretended. And we read of the like examples of other Saints, as namely, of Saint <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> when he put himſelfe to tread mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that ſoe hee might fly from honour, and from that reception which they had a minde to make him, and of <hi>Fryer Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper</hi> alſoe when he put himſelfe to play at boyes play with Children, out of the ſame end.</p>
               <p>Theis Saints conſidered, that the world deſpiſed the ſonne of God, who is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame and the infinite good; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the world to be ſoe deceiptfull and falſe, and that is was miſtaken in not knowing ſuch a reſplendent and cleare light, as the ſonne of God was, and in not honouring him who was moſt true
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7498:82"/>
and perfect honour; they conceiued ſuch a hatred and deteſtation againſt the world, and the eſtimation thereof, that they reproued all that which the world appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and they prayſed and loued all that which the world deſpiſes, and hates: and ſoe they fledd with great care, from being prayſed and eſteemed by the world which deſpiſed their God, and their lord: and they held it for a particular ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne of being beloued by Chriſt our lord, to be deſpiſed by the world with him, and for the loue of him. This is the cauſe, why Saints haue taken ſo much guſt, in the contumelies and affronts of the world; and haue tryed ſoe many conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for the obteyning to be contemned thereby. It is true, ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> that many of theis things were done by particular inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt, and ſoe are a more fitt obiect, for our admiration then for our imitation to worke vpon. But Though we arriue not to performe that holy kinde of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, in act, as thoſe Saints did, we muſt yet procure to imitate them in the loue, and great deſire which they had, to be vndervalued and deſpriſed.</p>
               <p>Saint Diadocus goes on further and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7498:82"/>
ſaith, that there are two kindes of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, <hi>Vna mediorum, altera perfectorum.</hi> The firſt is of the middle ſort, who are proficients, but yet are ſtill in the fight, and are combated with the thoughts of pride, and of ill motions, though they procure with the grace of our Lord, to reſiſt them by humbling and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelues. Another Humilitie the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is, which belonges to ſuch as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and this is when our lord communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates ſoe great light to a man, in the way of knowing himſelfe, that it ſeemes, as if now he could nor be proud, yea and that euen the motions thereof, could now come noe more. <hi>Tunc anima velut naturalem habet humilitatem. Then habt the ſoule, a kinde of Humilitie,</hi> euen as if it were naturall. For howſoeuer hee may performe greate things, yet he exalts not himſelfe one iott, the higher for that, nor doth he eſteeme himſelfe the more, but rather houlds himſelfe for inferiour to all. And he ſaith, there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene theis two kindes of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> commonly the firſt is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with ſome trouble, and paine, as being, in fine, perfourmed by ſuch a one, as hath not yet obteyned a perfect
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7498:83"/>
conqueſt of himſelfe, but ſtill feeles ſome contradiction; for this is indeede that, which giues ſorrow and paine: when the occaſion of Humiliation and diſeſtimation arriue; for in this caſe, they may take things with patience, but they cannot doe it with ioy; for ſtill there is ſome what within, which makes reſiſtance, becauſe the paſſions are not ouercome.</p>
               <p>But now the ſecond kinde of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> giues noe paine or greife at all, but rather much ioy (ſoe that the man be indeede in that confuſion &amp; ſhame and haue that true diſeſteeme and contempt of himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our lord) for ſuch a one, hath nothing now, which can make him any reſiſtance, in reguard that he hath conquered and ſubdued the contrary paſſions, and vices, and obteyned a perfect victory ouer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And from hence it is, ſayth the Saint, that they whoe haue but the firſt humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are troubled and altered, by the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and proſperities and variety of eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in this life. But as for them whoe poſſeſſe the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Humilitie,</hi> neither are they trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by things aduerſe, nor doe proſperous things make them giddy, or light; nor doe they cauſe any vaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment in them; but they euer ſtand faſt in one and the ſame kinde of State, and they inioy greate

much for our ſakes, will not recouer vs, and cure our pride, I know not, ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> what will euer be able to doe it. <hi>Haec medicina ſi ſuperbiam non curat, quid eam curet neſcio.</hi> If to ſee the Maieſtie of our Lord ſoe abaſed, and humbled, will not ſuffice to make vs aſhamed of deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be honored and eſteemed, and that heere vpon, wee yet will not growe to a thirſt of being deſpiſed; and a baſed with him, and for the loue of him, I know not what will euer ſerue the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. And <hi>Guericus</hi> the Abbott, being ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and conuinced by the great example of our Lords <hi>Humilitie,</hi> exclaimes, and expreſſes that which it is reaſon that we ſhould alſoe ſay, and drawe from hence. <hi>Viciſti Domine, vicisti ſuperbiam meam: ecce do manus in vincula tua, accipe ſeruum ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piternum.

               <p>It is alſoe an admirable conceipt, which the glorious <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> brings to this purpoſe. <hi>The ſonne of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſaw two creatures, and both were generous, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and capable of that bleſſed ſtate, to which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7498:87"/>
they had been created by Almightie God, and they both, loſt themſelues, becauſe they would needes be like him. God created the Angells, and inſtantly Lucifer had a minde to be like Almightie God. In coelum conſcenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuper aſtra dei exaltabo ſolium meum: ſedebo in monte teſtamenti, in lateribus Aquilonis; aſcendam ſuper altitudinem nubium, ſimilis ero altiſsimo: And then he carried others after him, and God caſt them inſtantly downe to Hell, and ſoe of Angells, they became deuills. Verumtamen ad infernum detraheris, ad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundum laci. God alſoe created man, and inſtantly the diuell ſtrucke him with his owne leproſie, and poyſon. Eritis ſicut dij, ſcientes bonum &amp; malum. They fell gluttonouſly vpon what he tould them, namely that they should be as God, and then they broke the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine comaundement, and ſoe became like the diuell. The Prophett Eliſeus, ſaid to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant Giezi after he tooke the preſents of the leprous Naaman, Thou haſt taken the goods of Naaman, and behould his leproſie shall alſoe ſticke to thee, and to all thy deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendents for euer. This was the iudgment of God against man, that ſince he would needes haue the riches of Lucifer which was his pride, he should alſo haue his leproſie, which was the punishment thereof. You ſee
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7498:88"/>
therefore heere, that man was alſoe vndone, and made like the Diuell, becauſe he would needes be like God. And what might now be fitt for the ſonne of God to doe, finding his eternall Father to be ſoe iealous, and carefull to maintaine his owne honour. Ecce, inquit occaſione mei, creaturas ſuas pater amittit. I ſee, ſaith hee, that, by my occaſion, my father looſes his creatures. The Angells would needes bee as I am, they ouerthrew themſelues; man would alſoe be ſoe, and he was alſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. They all haue enuy at me and would fayne be ſuch as I am. Well then, Ecce venio, &amp; talem eis exhibeo me ipſum, vt quiſquis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidere voluerit, quiſquis geſtierit imitari, fiat ei aemulatio iſta in bonum. Behould ſaith the ſonne of God, I will goe in ſuch a forme, that who ſoeuer will from hence forth, become like me, shall not looſe but gaine; and for this came the ſonne of God from heauen and made himſelfe man.</hi> O therefore, lett ſuch a bounty and mercy be bleſſed, and prayſed, and glorified, which moued Almightie God to condeſcend to that ſoe greate appetite, which wee had to be like him, for now wee may be as God, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to falſhood, and with a lye, and according to what the diuell ſaid, but according to truth; and not now with

pride, and mallice, but with much ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and Humilitie. Vpon thoſe words, <hi>Paruulus natus eſt nobis,</hi> the ſame Saint ſaith, <hi>Studeamus effici ſicut paruulus, diſca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſhowing that it is the roote and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the vertues, the ſhort way to acquire them, the meanes to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue them, and that, in fine, if we poſſeſſe this, we ſhall be Maſters of them all. But yet, that it may appeare, that wee meane not to carry it all, by the onely way of ſpiritt, it will not be a miſſe, that we deliuer ſome humaine conſiderations and reaſons, which may be more proportionable and connaturall to our weakenes; to the end that being ſoe conuinced not onely by vay of ſpiritt, and of perfection, but euen of natural reaſon alſoe, wee may haue both more courage, and more affection to the contempt of honour, and eſtimation of the world, and to proceede in the way of Humilitie; for all this will be needefull, for the acquiring of a thing ſoe hard as this; and ſo it will be well, that wee helpe our ſelues of it all.</p>
               <p>Let it therefore be the firſt, that we put our ſelues to conſider, and examine at good leaſure, and with attention, what thing this honour, and eſtimation of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

then it deſerues, and may animate our ſelues to deſpiſe it, and not contynue in ſoe much errour, as now wee finde our ſelues ſubiect to. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid very well, <hi>that there are many things, which wee hould to bee great, not becauſe indeede they are great; but becauſe our poorenes, and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednes is ſuch, that the ſmall ſeemes great, and the little much, to vs.</hi> And he brings the example of that weight, which is ordinarily carryed by Ants: which in reſpect of their body is very great, being yet very ſmall in it ſelfe; and iuſt ſoe it is, with the honour and eſtimation of the world. If you deny it, I would aske whether you be indeede, either the better becauſe others eſteeme you, or the worſe becauſe they eſteeme you not? Infaillibly you are not.

                  <hi>This is that which imports, the reſt is foolery,</hi> for it neither giues, nor takes away. This is that, which that other Saint ſaith. <hi>What is a man the better for being prayſed by another. And as much as any man is in the ſight of God, ſoe much indeede he is, and noe more, as the humble.</hi> Saint <hi>Francis</hi> ſaid, or rather as was ſaid by the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paule.

               </p>
               <p>Sainct Auguſtine brings a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, to this purpoſe. <hi>Est enim ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, non magnitudo, ſed tumor: quod autem tumet, videtur magnum, ſed non eſt tamen. Pride and estimation of the vorld, is not greatnes but ſwelling and winde.</hi> And as when any parte is ſwelled, it ſeemes, but is not truely great, ſoe proud men, whoe are valued and eſteemed by the world, ſeeme as if they were great, but they are not ſoe; becauſe that is not greatnes but ſwelling. There are certaine ſickly men, whoe ſometymes are thought to be vpon recouery, becauſe they ſeeme to looke fatt, and well, but that fattnes is not ſound, and good, but it is rather ſickly, and ſwelling. <hi>Soe</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine, is the applauſe and eſtimation of the world, it may

puffe you vp, but it cannot make you greate.</hi> If then it be ſoe, that the opinion and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the world is not any thing of greatnes in it ſelfe, but rather of ſicknes and ſwelling, why doe wee goe vp and downe like Camelions, ſucking in winde with our mouthes open, that ſoe we may be the more ſwolne, and ſicke? It is better for a man to be in health, though hee ſeeme ſicke, then to be ſicke, and ſeeme ſound ſoe alſoe is it better to be good, though hee ſeeme wicked, then to be wicked, and be held for good. For what good will it doe you, to be held vertuous, &amp; ſpirituall if indeede you be not ſoe. <hi>Et laudent eum in portis opera eius.</hi> Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith vpon theis words, <hi>Not the vaine prayſes of men, but your good works muſt defend and prayſe you when you appeare in iudgment, before Almightie God.</hi>

               <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> recounts how in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of <hi>Hiconia,</hi> there was a certaine Moncke who was generally in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of being a ſaynt, and eſpecially for being very abſtinent, and full of pennance alſoe, otherwiſe. But the hower of his death being come, he deſired that all the Moncks might be called to him. For their parts they were very glad of it, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing,

that they were to heare from him, ſome, matter of much edification, but he trembled, and was full of anguiſh &amp; found himſelfe compelled from within, to declare his true ſtate to them. And ſoe he made them knowe, that he was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe all his life had bene but Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. For when they thought hee faſted, and did much pennance, he eate ſecretly when they ſaw him not, and for this faith hee, am I now deliuered ouer to a terrible and furious beaſt, whoſe tayle hath wreathed it ſelfe about, and tyed my feete, and his head is already entring now into my mouth, to fetch our and carry a way my ſoule with him for euer. And with this words he expired, to the greate amazement of them all. And now, what was theis miſerable creature, the better for hauing bene reputed a Saint?</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> compares proud men, whoe goe in ſearch of honour, to children whoe hunt butterflyes.

               <p>IF with all that which we haue ſaid, you will not yet forſake theis fumes, &amp; abate that edge and deſire of honour, and eſtimation, but will ſtill be ſaying, that in fine it is a greate pointe, to hould a good opinion, and eſtimation amongſt men, and that this imports very much, euen for the edification of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and for many other things, and that the wiſeman Councells vs to haue a care thereof, <hi>Curam habe de bono nomine:</hi> I ſay lett it be ſoe, in the name of God; I am content that you haue care to keepe

But yet I giue you to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand with all, that if you deſire it, as you ſay you doe, you erre, euen in order to that for which you deſire it, and that you ſhall neuer obtaine that end, by this meanes, but the direct contrary. The ſafe and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine way, whereby you ſhall infaillibly come to be much valued, and eſteemed by men, is vertue, and Humilitie, as Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith. Procure euery one of you in particular, to be a good Religious man, and to be the meaneſt, and humbleſt of all the reſt, and that you may appeare to be ſoe, by your manner of proceding; and in the occaſions which ſhall preſent themſelues, and ſoe you ſhall be valued, and eſteemed by all men. This is indeede the honour of a Religious man, whoe hath forſaken the world; and whome it is a better ſight to ſee with a broome in his hand, and a poore coate vpon his backe, in the exerciſe of ſome lowe and meane office, then to behould a Caualier, with horſe and armes. And on the contrary ſide, for him to deſire to be valued, and eſteemed by men, as a diſhonour and affront to him as it were to goe out of his

For this eſtimation, is the moſt truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging tho the world, and that which you forſooke, and from which you fledd when you came to be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men.</p>
               <p>Will you cleerely ſee how ſhamefull, and reproachfull a thing it is, for ſuch men to affect the eſtimation of the world, who profeſſe to aſpire towards perfection? Let ſuch a deſire come but once ſoe to light, as that others may diſcerne that you deſire it; and you will quickly finde, how much your ſelfe will be confounded, and out of countenance, that any ſuch thing ſhould be conceiued of you. Wee haue a very good example of this, in the holy Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. The Euangeliſts relate, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles went once with Chriſt our Lord but yet at ſuch diſtance from him that they might thinke he heard them not, and ſoe

And the holy Ghoſpell ſaith, that the poore men were ſoe aſhamed, and out of countenance to ſee their pretention and ambition diſcouered, that they had not one word to ſay. <hi>At illi tacebant, ſiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem in via inter ſe diſputauerant, quis eorum maior eſſet.</hi> But then did the Sauiour of the world take them in hand, and ſay.

would not for the world either ſay or doe them, euen though there were noe ſuch thinge as God, or vertue, but meerely for that reputation, and honors ſake, which is ſoe eagerly purſued. How many tymes doth it happen, that a man is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and complaines, becauſe they made noe reckning of him, in ſuch an occaſion, or that they preferred ſome other before him in ſuch a buſines; he conceiuing that it belonged to him, and that he receiued a wronge thereby, and that it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to his diſhonor and diminution, and that it will lye as a note vpon him, and that others will diſcouer it, &amp; reflect vpon it, and vnder this colour, he giues them to vnderſtand the exception which he takes, and the trouble which he ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by meanes whereof in very deede, he remaines more noted, and diſeſteemed, becauſe he is held now for proud, and for a man that ſtands vpon certaine pointes of honour, which heere in a courſe of Religion, is a moſt abhominable kinde of thinge. Whereas, if he would haue paſſed it ouer, and neglected himſelfe, and giuen way, that Superious might do their will, he might haue gayned much honour, and bene much eſteemed for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:7498:99"/>Soe that, though there were noe ſuch thinge as a way of ſpirit, but that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were onely to liue in a courſe of prudence, and diſcretion, yea and euen according to the very lawes of the world, the true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine way for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be valued, eſteemed affected, and beloued by men, is to addict himſelfe ſeriouſly to acquire vertue, &amp; Humilitie.

If you ſpeake euer well, and doe better.</hi> And it is related of another Philoſopher, that he had a great freind, whoe in euery occaſion ſpoke all good of him and telling him one day that he owed him much, becauſe where ſoeuer he chanced to be, he prayſed him much, and ſpake much of his vertues, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher anſwered him thus, <hi>I pay you well

               </p>
               <p>But now we ſay not, for all this, that wee muſt giue our ſelues to vertue, and <hi>Humilitie,</hi> to the end that we may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, and eſteemed by men, for that were pride, and a peruerſe error.

                  </gap> ſound mortification to him, and it was this. Hee goeing one morning very early to the Court, in order to the reuenge which he had deſſigned, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a warrant from the king for the executing thereof, it hapned that the night before, the king, not hauing bene able to ſleepe, comaunded them to bring him the Hiſtory and Cronicles of his tymes, and when by courſe of readinge, they were come to thoſe particulars, of what <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> had donne in ſeruice of the king, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of a certaine treaſon, which
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7498:103"/>
ſome of his owne ſeruants, had plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt him, he inquired what reward had bene giuen that man, for that ſeruice; and they told him none at all. The king then asked, whoe was without, and whether yet men were come to make their Court. They told him that <hi>Aman</hi> was there, and ſoe he was bidden to enter. The king then asked him this queſtion. What will it be fitt to doe for that man, tho whome the king deſires to doe honour.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Aman</hi> conceiuing that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was to be the man, to whome that honour was to be done, made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: The man whome the king deſires to honour, ſhould be cladd in the kings princely robes, and ſett vpon the kings owne horſe, with the Crowne Royall vpon his head: and one of the prime men of the Court, ſhould goe before him, leading the horſe in his hand, &amp; proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, thus in the publique places of the Cittie, <hi>Thus is he to be honoured whome the king will honour.</hi> Well then, ſaid the king goe thou to that <hi>Mardochaeus,</hi> who keepes about the court gate and doe then all that to him, which thou haſt ſaid to me, &amp; be ſure thou faile in noe one circumſtance.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7498:104"/>
Thinke now what wound of anguiſh, that wicked and proud hart would feele but in fine he durſt not faile of executing the order to a haire. It ſeemed to bee beyond imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to thinke of a greater mortification then this was for him; but yet inſtantly after, followed that other, of his being hanged vpon that very gibbett, which hee had cauſed to be prouided for <hi>Mardochaeus.</hi> This is the pay which the world is wont to giue to ſuch as ſerue it.</p>
               <p>And now lett vs conſider, from whence all this Cataſtrophe grew: Becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth <hi>Mardochaeus</hi> would not riſe vp, and doe him reuerence, when he paſſed by. For ſuch a foolery as this is, able to keepe proud men, ſo vnquiet and reſtles, that they ſhall euer be wounded by it, and made ſadd at the hart. And ſoe we ſee it, at this day in worldly men; and ſoe much more doe wee ſee it, as the men are in more eminent place. For all ſuch things as theis, are as ſoe many needles points, to them, which galle, and tranſpearce them from ſide to ſide, nor is there any ſharper launce which they can feele, nor doe they euer want their part of this, how much ſoeuer they are extolled, and what ſoeuer they poſſeſſe; but they euer haue
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7498:104"/>
their harts as bitter as gall, and they euer walke vp and downe the world, with perpetuall vnquietnes, and want of reſt. And the ſame will alſoe happen heere in Religion, if a man be proud? for then he will alſoe heere, reflect whether they make ſoe much accounte of him as of others: and in w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How many haue bene put to runne ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their vocation, by ſuch things as theis? Nay how many haue thus bene drawne out of Religion, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that they could not contynue without being affronted, and that they ſhould neuer be valued and eſteemed. Yea how many haue by this meanes, beene brought by little and little, to indaunger their ſaluation.

               <p>From hence we may vnderſtand, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular which we experiment very often, namely that although it be true, that there is a ſicknes of melancholy, yet many tymes it happens that a mans being melancholy and ſadd, is not the humour of Melancholy, or any corporall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, but it is the very humour of pride, which is a ſicknes of the ſowle. You are melancholy and ſadd, becauſe you are forgotten and caſt a ſide, into ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and becauſe they make noe accounte of you. You are Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>coly and ſad, becauſe you performed not ſuch or ſuch a thinge with ſoe much creditt, and reputation, as you figured to your ſelfe; but rather you conceiue that you are diſgraced. The buſines proued not as you deſired; that ſermon, that diſputation, thoſe Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but you rather thinke that you haue loſt opinion and credit by it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are Melancholy and ſadd, yea and when you are to doe any of theis pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicque things, the very feare of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and whether you ſhall gaine or looſe honor by it, makes you afflicted
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7498:105"/>
and greiued. Theis are ſome of thoſe things, which make the proud man Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and ſadd. But now the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of hart, who deſire noe honour, or eſtimation, and contents himſelfe with a meane place, is free from all this reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and diſquiet, and enioyes great peace, according to the words of Chriſt our Lord, from whome that ſaynt tooke this ſaying of his. <hi>If there be peace in this world, the humble of hart poſſeſſes it.</hi> And therefore though there were noe way of ſpiritt or perfection to be looked after, but onely our owne intereſt, and the keeping our harts in peace, and quietnes, euen for this, and this alone, we were to procure <hi>Humilitie;</hi> for thus wee ſhould come to liue, whereas the other is but to leade a kinde of dying life.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to this purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countes a certaine thinge of himſelfe, whereby he ſaith, that our Lord gaue him to vnderſtand the blindnes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, wherein hee was. <q>As I went one day (ſayth he) full of affliction and care in thought of a certaine Oration which I was to recite before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in his praiſe, whereof the greateſt parte was to be falſe:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7498:106"/>
and my ſelfe procuring to be prayſed for my paines, euen by them who know that it would be falſe (that men may ſee how farr the vanitie, and folly and madnes of the world, extends it ſelfe,) as I went I ſay with much thought heereof, and was full of trouble and care, how the buſines might ſucceede, and hauing as it were euen a kinde of feauer vpon me of conſuming thoughts, it hapned, that in one of the ſtreetes of <hi>Milan,</hi> there was a poore begger who, after he had gotten well to eate, and drinke, was playing tricks, and taking his pleaſure, and in fine, was very merry and iolly. But when I ſaw this, I fell to ſigh, and repreſent to my freinds whoe were preſent there, to what miſery our madnes had made vs ſubiect. Since in all our troubles, and namely in thoſe where in we found our ſelues at that tyme, (carrying a great burthen of infelicity vpon our backs, and beinge wounded with the vexation of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inordinate appetites and dayly adding one burthen to another) we did not ſoe much as procure to ſeeke any other thing, then onely ſome ſecure kinde of contentment, and ioy, wherein
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7498:106"/>
that poore begger had outſtripped vs already, whoe perhaps ſhould neuer be able to ouertake him therein. For that, which hee had now obteyned by meanes of a little almes namely the ioy of temporall felicitie, I ſtill went ſeeking and hunting out, with ſoe much ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and care. It is true, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that the poore man had noe true ioy, but it is alſoe true that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment which I ſought, was more falſe then his; and in fine hee then was merry, and I ſad, he was ſecure, and I full of cares &amp; feares. And if any man ſhould aske me now, whether I had rather be glad or greiued, I ſhould quickly make anſwere, that I had rather be glad; and if he ſhould aske me yet againe, whether I had rather be that begger or my ſelfe, I ſhould then rather chooſe to be my ſelfe, though I were then full of afflictions but yet for ought I know, I ſhould haue noe reaſon to make this choiſe. For I aske what cauſe I can alledge, for my being more learned gaue me then noe contentment at all; but onely deſired to giue contentment to others, by my knowledge, and yet that, not by way of inſtructing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7498:107"/>
But without doubt, (ſaith hee,) that poore man was more happye then I; not onely becauſe he was merry and iolly, when I was full of cogitations and cares, which drew euen my very bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells out of my body: but becauſe he had gotten his wine by lawfull meanes, whereas I was hunting after vaine glory by the way of tellinge lyes.</q>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7498:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeemes that: that happens to vs heerein, which occurrs to others whoe are full of feare. For how many reaſons ſoeuer you giue to perſwade ſuch perſons, that they haue no cauſe to feare ſuch or ſuch a thing, they yet make this anſwere, <hi>I ſee well that all you ſay is true and I would faine not feare, but yet I cannot obteyne it of my ſelfe.</hi> For iuſt ſoe, ſome ſay in our caſe, I well perceiue that all thoſe reaſons which you haue brought againſt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and eſtimation of the world, are good and true, and they conuince that all is but meere vanitie and winde, but yet with all this, I cannot by any meanes; Wynne ſoe much of my ſelfe, as not to make ſome accounte thereof. I would faine doe it if I could, but me thinke I know not how this kinde of things, tranſports and diſquiets me ſtrangely. Well then, as noe reaſons and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, are ſufficient to free the fearefull man from feare, but that beſides this, we muſt intreate him to put his hand to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, and bid him draw neere, to feele, and touch thoſe things, which ſeemed to him to be bugbeares and ſprights; and aduiſe him to goe ſometyme by night, and alone to the ſame places where he thought he

ſaw them, that ſoe he might finde by experience, that there was nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, but that all was his imagination and apprehenſion, that ſoe by this meanes he may looſe his feare: ſoe alſoe for the makeing vs giue ouer the deſire of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and eſtimation of the world, the Saints affirme, that noe reaſons or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations are ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but that we muſt alſo vſe the meanes of action, and of the exerciſe of humilitie, for this is the principall and moſt efficatious meanes, which, we for our parts, can imploy, towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning of this vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Baſill</hi> ſaith, that as ſciences and arts are acquired by practiſe, ſoe alſoe are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertues. That a man may be a good Muſition, a good Rethorition, a good Philoſopher and a good workema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any kinde, let him exerciſe himſelfe herein, and he will grow perfect. And ſoe alſoe, for obteyning the habit of Humilitie, and all the reſt of the morall vertues, wee muſt exerciſe our ſelues in the acts thereof, and by this meanes wee ſhall poſſeſſe them. And if any man will tell me, that for the compoſing and moderating our paſſions, and the affections of the minde, and for the obteyning alſoe of vertue, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7498:108"/>
and reaſons, the docume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and Councells of holy Scripture are ſufficient, he is deceiued as <hi>S. Baſill</hi> ſaith. <hi>Is ſimiliter facit, vt ſi quis diſceret aedificare, nec vnquam aedificaret, &amp; aes cundere, &amp; quae didiciſſet, ea in actum numqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> educeret. This would be like him whoe should learne to build a howſe, or coyne mony, and would neuer exerciſe himſelfe therein; but that all should paſſe in hearing the documents, and rules of arte, in which caſe it is certaine, that he would neuer proue good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keman.</hi> And as little will he grow to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe Humility, or any other vertue, who will not exerciſe himſelfe therein. And in confirmation heereof, the Saint brings that of the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paule. Non enim au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditores legis iuſti ſunt apud deum, ſed factores legis, iuſtificabu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur.</hi> It is not enough for this purpoſe to heare many documents and reaſons, but they muſt be put in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For practiſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duces more to this buſines then all the ſpeculation in the world. And though it be moſt true, that all vertue and euery thing which is good, muſt come to vs from the hand of God, and that we cannot compaſſe it by our owne ſtrength; yet the ſame lord, whoe is to giue it, is pleaſed that we ſhould helpe our ſelues, by our owne endeauours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:7498:109"/>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon thoſe words of Chriſt our Lord: <hi>Si ergo ego laui pedes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtros, Dominus &amp; magiſter, &amp; vos debetis, alter alterius lauare pedes,</hi> ſaith, that this is that, which Chriſt our Lord intended to teach vs, by this example, of waſhing his deſciples feete: <hi>Hoc eſt beate Petre, quod neſciebas, quando fieri non ſinebas, hoc tibi poſtea ſciendum promiſit: Ecce ipſum eſt poſtea. This is that O B. Peter which thou didſt not know when thou wouldſt not conſent that Chriſt should wash thy feete, He promiſed that thou shouldſt know it afterward, and now,</hi> that afterward <hi>is come, and now thou shalt vnderſtand it.</hi> And it is, that if wee will obteyne the vertue of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> we muſt exerciſe our ſelues in the exteriour acts thereof. <hi>Exemplum enim dedi vobis, vt quemadmodum ego feci vobis, ita &amp; vos facia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. For I haue giuen you an example, to the end that you may doe as I haue done. Didici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus fratres humilitatem ab excelſo faciamus inuicem humiles, quod ſimiliter fecit excelſus.</hi> Since the omnipotent, and ſoueraigne Lord, humbled himſelfe: ſince the ſunne of God, abaſed and imployed himſelfe in meane, and lowly exerciſes, waſhing the feete of his diſciples, ſeruing his <hi>Bleſſed Mother</hi> and the holy <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7498:109"/>
and obedient to them in what ſoeuer they commaunded, lett vs learne of them &amp; exerciſe our ſelues in hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble and meane imployments, and thus we ſhal come to obtaine the vertue of <hi>Humilitie.</hi> This is alſoe that which Saint Bernard ſaith. <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliatio via eſt ad humilitatem, ſicut patientia ad pacem, ſicut lectio ad ſcientiam. The humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of the exteriour man, is the way and meanes, to obtaine the vertue of Humilitie, as patience is, for the obteyning peace, and reading or ſtudy for the obteyning knowledge. Si vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem appetis Humilitatis, viam non refugias humiliationis, nam ſi non poteris humiliari, non poteris ad humilitatem prouehi.</hi> And therefore if you will obtaine the vertue of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> doe not fly from the exerciſe of humiliation: for if you ſay, that either you cannot, or will not humble or abaſe your ſelues; as little haue you a minde to obtaine the vertue of <hi>Humilitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> proues it very well, and giues the reaſon, why this exerciſe of humiliation, is ſo vſefull, important, and neceſſary for the obteining of true humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of hart. <hi>Cum enim ad pedes fratris inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur corpus, etiam in corde ipſo vel excitatur, vel ſi iam inerat, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatur, ipſius humilitatis affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</hi> The interiour &amp; exteriour man are ſoe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7498:110"/>
interlaced and vnited together, and the one depends ſo much vpon the other, that when the body is humbled and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the hart is ſtirred vpp towards the loue of Humilitie. That humbling my ſelfe before my brother, and kiſſing his feete, hath ſome what in it; that poore and meane coate, that low and baſe office, hath I know not what which goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring, and breeding <hi>Humilitie</hi> in the hart, and if it be there already, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues and increaſes it. And thus Saint <hi>Dorotheus</hi> anſweres this queſtion, how a man with a poore and meane coate, which belongs to the body, may come to obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the vertue of humilitie which inhabits the ſoule? For it is certaine, ſaith hee, that the body in many caſes, giues a good or ill diſpoſition to the ſoule. And ſoe we ſee the ſoule hath one kinde of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the body is well, and an other when it is ſicke; O when it is full fedd, and another when it is very hungry. Now in the ſelfe ſame manner, the ſoule veſts it ſelfe with one kinde of inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when a man is ſeated vpon a throne, or vpon a horſe richly adorned, and with another, when he ſitts vpon the ground, or is riding vpon a iade; and one kinde of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7498:110"/>
inclination, when a man is ſeated vpon a throne, or vpon a horſe richly adorned, and with another, when he ſitts vpon the ground, or is ryding vpon a iade; and one kinde of inclination it hath, when he is ſet out in ſumptuous cloathes, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he is but couered with a poore coate.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> alſo noted this very well; and ſaith, <hi>that as gallant and shiuing attire, lifts vp the harts of worldly men, and ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in them, certaine fumes of vanitie of proper estimation and pride, ſo doth a poore and meane habit, awake in the hart of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, and of the ſeruants of God, an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Humility, and it breedes a diſeſteeme of ones ſelfe; and it makes men indure better, to be deſpiſed.</hi> And the ſaynt adds further, <hi>That as wordly men deſire rich, and glorious cloathes, that ſoe they may be the better knowne, and the more honored, and eſteemed, thereby; ſo the good ſeruants of God, and ſuch as are truly humble, deſire to be poorely and meanely cladd, that ſoe they may be valued the leſſe: and eſpecially, becauſe they conceiue themſelues to finde much helpe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, towards their conſeruation, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in true Humilitie.</hi> Amongſt all the exteriour humiliations, that of poore
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7498:111"/>
and meane cloathing is one of the cheefe, and for this, wee finde it to haue bene ſoe much vſed, by ſuch as are truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Wee reade in the life of <hi>Father Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus Xauier,</hi> that he euer went very poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely cladd, to conſerue himſelfe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Humilitie, and fearing leaſt ſome little eſtimation, or preſumption, might mingle and wrap it ſelfe vp in good cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, as it vſes to happen many thymes.</p>
               <p>It will alſoe appeare by another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that towards the purchaſe of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie</hi> of hart, or any other interiour ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the exteriour exerciſe of the ſame vertue doth profitt much, becauſe the will is much more moued thereby, then by bare deſires. For it is cleere that the preſent obiect moues vs more, then the abſent; as we ſee that wee are moued more by ſeeing things then by hearing of them; and from hence the Prouerbe came, <hi>That which the eyes ſee not, the hart rues not.</hi> Soe that the exteriour thing which is put in practiſe, moues the will much more, becauſe the obiect is there preſent, then meere apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour deſires do, where the obiect is not preſent, but onely in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceite, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. One great affront well endured
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7498:111"/>
with a good will, ſhall breede more of the vertue of patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in your ſoule, then fower affronts will doe, when you haue but the onely deſire without the deede. And the ſpending of one day, in exerciſing ſome meane and lowe office, and the wearing ſome poore and tottered coate ſome one day, will helpe your ſoule more to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>humilitie,</hi> then many dayes of meere deſires wil doe. Wee haue experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce euery day, that a man hath repugnance to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme one of the ordinary mortifications which wee vſe; and within two or three dayes after. He hath begun, to doe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he findes noe difficultie therein at all, and yet before he did them, he had conceiued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purpoſes, and deſires thereof, and yet ſtill they were not ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge enough to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the difficulty. And for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth the ſociety vſe certaine publique mortifications, as wee reade to haue bene done by many SS. becauſe when once a man hath performed one of theis, he getts the maſtery ouer himſelfe, for other things wherein he found difficultie before. And to this we may add, that which is ſaid by the ſchole-diuines, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the interiour act is accompanied by the exteriour, it is commonly more efficatious, and intenſe.

So that, it helpes much in all reſpects, towards the obteyning of the vertue of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> to imploy our ſelues exteriourly about obiects which are meane and baſe.</p>
               <p>And becauſe vertue is conſerued, and augmented by the ſame meanes, whereby it is obteyned, therefore as the exteriour exerciſe of <hi>Humilitie</hi> is neceſſary for the obteyning the vertue of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> it will alſoe be neceſſary for the cuſtody and increaſe thereof; where vpon it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that this exerciſe is very important for all and not onely for beginners, but for others alſoe, who eare great profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, as we alſoe ſaid when we were trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Mortification.</hi> And ſoe our <hi>Father,</hi> in the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Rules,</hi> recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds it much to vs all in theſe words: <hi>Magno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere confert deuotè quo ad fieri poterit, ea mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera obire, in quibus magis exercetur humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas, &amp; Charitas. It will greately helpe that we performe thoſe offices with all poſsible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, wherein Humilitie and Charitie are exerciſed most.</hi> And in another place he ſaith: <hi>Temptations are to be preuented by their contraries, as when there is opinion, that ſuch a one is inclined to pride, he must be exerciſed in ſuch meane things, as may be likely to helpe him towards Humility; and ſoe in other
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7498:112"/>
ill inclinations.</hi> And yet, in another place. <hi>As for meane and baſe imployments, men ought redily to accept of thoſe wherein they finde moſt repugnance, when ſoeuer they shal be ſoe ordeyned.</hi> So that finally I ſay, that theis two things <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,</hi> muſt helpe one another; and from the interiour <hi>Humilitie</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in deſpiſing himſelfe, and deſiring to be held by others in ſmall accounte, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour humiliation is to growe, that the man may exteriourly ſhew himſelfe to be the ſame, that interiourly he tooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be. Namely, that as the humble man is interiourly contemptible in his owne eyes, and houlds himſelfe to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of all honor, ſoe muſt treate himſelfe alſoe exteriourly; that the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Works which he performes, may viſibly declare the interiour <hi>Humilitie,</hi> which is in his harte. Chooſe you the loweſt place, as Chriſt our Lord aduiſed; deſpiſe not to treate with perſons whoe are poore, and meane, be gladd of the moſt inferiour imployments; and this very exteriour humiliation which ſprings from the interiour, will giue increaſe to that very fountaine alſoe, from which it ſprings.</p>

                  <hi>PEtrus Cluniacenſus</hi> recounts, that in the Order of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> there was a Religious man of holy, and vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted life, whome our lord had conſerued ſo chaſt, ſo pure, &amp; ſo intyre, that he had neuer ſuffered any illuſion, euen in his ſleepe. But being come to the hower of his death, and all the Religious aſſiſting at the bedd ſide of the ſicke man, the Prior whoe was alſoe there, commaunded him to tell them, what that thing in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular was, whereby he might conceiue himſelfe to haue pleaſed our lord moſt in the whole courſe of his life. Hee made him this anſweare. <q>Father you commaund me a hard thing, &amp; I ſhould by no meanes tell you, what you aske, if I were not obliged to it by <hi>Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> From my infancy, I haue bene much afflicted
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7498:113"/>
and perſecuted by the diuell; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of the troubles and tribulations which I ſuſteyned, my ſoule was ſtill refreſhed, by thoſe many conforts which Chriſt our lord, and the <hi>glorious virgin Mary his moſt Bleſſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> imparted to me. I therefore being one day much afflicted and euen ouer-wrought by greate temptations of the diuell, this <hi>ſoueraigne virgin,</hi> appeared to me, and vpon her preſence, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills fledd, and all their temptations were at an end. And after ſhe had comforted and incouraged me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer, and proceede in the way of vertue and perfection, ſhe ſaid thus to me. To the end that thou maiſt the better doe that which I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, I will fetch thee in particular, out of the treaſures of my ſonne, three wayes or exerciſes of Humilitie; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein if thou imploy thy ſelfe, thou wilt highly pleaſe God, and ſhalt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thine enemies. Namely that thou humble thy ſelfe in theis three things, in thy foode, in thy cloathing, and in the offices or dutyes which thou art to diſcharge. So that in thy foode, thou muſt deſire and procure the worſt;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7498:114"/>
and in thy cloathing, the moſt meane and courſe; and as for thy imployments or offices, indeauour thou euer, to get the moſt baſe and meane, eſteeming it both for a great honour and profitt for thee, to exerciſe thy ſelfe in ſuch as are moſt refuſed and deſpiſed; and which other men diſdaine, and from which they fly: and hauing ſaid thus much ſhe vaniſhed. For my part I imprinted the power, and efficacie of thoſe words of hers in my hart: that ſoe from that tyme forward, I might doe as I had bene taught by her, and my ſoule hath found much good by it.</q>

                  <hi>Caſsianus</hi> relates of the Abbott <hi>Paphmiſius</hi> that being a moncke in Egipt, and Abbot of the Monaſtery he was much eſteemed, &amp; honored by the Moncks, both as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; a Maſter, for his venerable old age, and his admirable life. But he being troubled With receiuing ſoe much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, &amp; deſireing to ſee himſelfe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, deſpiſed, and forgotten, went ſecretly one night from his Monaſtery, and putting on a ſecular habit, went to a certaine Monaſtery of <hi>Pachomius,</hi> Which was very farr from his: and then floriſhed much in all kinde of ſanctity. And this
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7498:114"/>
he did to the end that being vnknowne, they might treate him as a nouice, and might eſteeme little of him. This holy man ſtayed there many dayes at the gate, both proſtrate and vpon his knees, before all the Moncks, who of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſeemed to contemne him; and caſt it in his teeth, that now, when he was euen tyred with inioying the world, he came in his old age, to ſerue God, when it might ſeeme, that he was rather drawne by neceſſitie, and to gett bread to eate: and that they might rather ſerue him, then be ſerued by him. But in fine, they receiued him, giuing him charge of the Orchard of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and aſſigneing him a Superiour, whome he was in all things to obey. But ſtill, when he had performed his owne office with all exactnes, and Humility, he did moreouer procure to doe all thoſe things alſoe, which others refuſed, as being the moſt troubleſome of the howſe. Yea, and not contenting himſelfe with this, he would be ryſing ſecretly in the nigh, &amp; putting the whole howſe in order, the beſt he could, without being ſeene by any of the reſt,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7498:115"/>
who would be wondring at it in the morninge, as not knowing by whome it had bene done. Hee remayned thus three yeares, &amp; was very glad of the occaſion which then was fallne into his hand, of labouring hard, and being little eſteemed: for this was the ſcope of his whole deſire. But his owne Moncks being much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for the abſence of ſuch a Father, went ſome of them ſeuerall wayes, and hauing ſought him three yeares, and being then full of feare, that they ſhould neuer finde him out, behould one of them paſſed at length by that Monaſtery of <hi>Pachomius,</hi> with little opinion to meete with him, and yet in fine he diſcouered, and knew the Saint, as he was manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and dunging the ſoyle. Hee caſt himſelfe inſtantly at his feete, and they who ſaw it, were amaſed thereat; and ſoe they were much more, when they knew particularly whoe he was, for both the man, and his actions, had before, bene knowne to them by fame. They begged pardon of him, but the old ſaynt bewailed his misfortune, in hauing bene ſoe diſcouered, by the enuye of the diuell, and in hauing now loſt the treaſure which formely he had found
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7498:115"/>
there. They ledd him though it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, to his Monaſtery, where he was receiued with incomparable ioy, and from that tyme forward, they looked to him with extraordinary diligence. But yet, through the great deſire he had to be deſpiſed, and vnknowne, and through the delight and guſt he had taken, in that humble manner of life, which he ledd in the other Monaſterie, all this was not able to keepe him from getting out another night, he hauing formerly agreed with one, that he would paſſe by ſhipp in to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> which was very farre diſtant from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. This accordingly was done, and he arriued at the Monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of <hi>Caſsianus.</hi> But our lord who euer takes care to exalt the humble, ordeyned that he ſhould alſoe be diſcouered by ſome Moncks of his, who went to viſitt thoſe holy places, and the Bleſſed old man was much the more honored for theis things.</p>
               <p>In the liues of the Fathers, it is related of a certaine Moncke, that hauing liued a long tyme in the ſolitude of a deſert, in great pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation, a thought came once into his minde, that now he was growne to be perfect and he put
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7498:116"/>
himſelfe into prayer, and ſaid thus to God. Shew me O lord, what I want, towards perfection. And God being reſolued to humble his thoughts, made him heare a voice which ſaid thus to him. Goe thy wayes to ſuch a perſon (who was a man that kept hogs thereby) and do that which he ſhall tell thee: and at the ſame tyme it was reuealed to that other, that the Hermitt was comeing to ſpeake with him, and that himſelfe was to tell the other, that he muſt take his whippe, and looke to his hoggs. The old Hermitt came, and after ſalutations hee ſaid thus. <hi>I greatly deſire to ſerue God, and therefore tell me, for Charitie, what I should doe in order to this end.</hi> The other asked him then if he would doe what he badd him to which the old man anſweared, That he would. Then ſaid the other, <hi>take this whipp and goe and looke to thoſe hoggs,</hi> The old man obeyed him, becauſe he deſired to ſerue God, and to obtaine what he wanted of perfection. And ſoe hee went with his whipp, and kept hogs, and they who knew him, who were very many, (by reaſon of the ſame of his ſanctitie in thoſe parts) ſeeing him keepe hoggs ſaid thus: <hi>Doe you ſee how this old Hermitt, of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7498:116"/>
whome we haue heard ſoe great things, is turned a mad man, &amp; goes locking to hogs. His great faſts and his much pennance haue,</hi> as it ſeemes, dryed his braine, and put him out of his witts. The good old man who heard them ſay theis things, tooke it all with much patience and Humilitie, and ſoe contynued ſome dayes. But God ſeeing that <hi>Humilitie</hi> of his and that he tooke thoſe affronts and ſcornes in good parte, comaunded him to returne to his former place.</p>

And ſoe putting on poore cloathes, he hyres himſelfe out to the publicque works which were there on foote, at that tyme, and mainteyned himſelfe by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his hands.

This man, diuers tymes, ſaw the holy Biſhop ſleepe vpon the bare ground, and ſaw alſo a piller of fyer, which roſe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7498:117"/>
from him, and reached vp to heauen, at which hee maruailed much, when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued him to be ſoe poore a man, and ſoe foule with the durt of the building, &amp; ſoe ouer growne with haire and beard, and who liued in ſoe meane &amp; conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an imployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. At length, he could not conteine himſelfe, but called him one day a parte, and asked him what he was. The Saint told him, that he was one of the poore of the Cittie, and that he ſpent his tyme in that labour, as not being able to maintaine himſelfe otherwiſe. But this anſweare did not ſatisfie the Conde, the will of God being ſuch, for the honor of his ſeruant, through the diſcouery of his <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and ſoe he perſiſted in asking him often the ſame queſtions, with ſoe great inſtance, that at length he made him diſcouer himſelfe, for ſo he did, vpon two Conditions which the Conde accepted. The one, that whilſt he liued, the Conde ſhould neuer diſcouer what he ment to tell him; and the other that he ſhould not aske him his name. Onely he tould him that he was a biſhopp, and that he had fled to that place, that ſoe he might fly from honor and eſtimation.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Iohn Climacus</hi> recounts of a certaine

principall man of Alexandria, who came to be receiued in a certaine Monaſtery; And when the Abbot perceiued him, both by his aſpect, and other ſignes, to be a man of harſh condition, and to be haughtie, ſwolne vp by the vanities of the world, he reſolued to lead him on by the ſecure way of Humilitie, and then ſaid thus to him. <hi>If really you be reſolued to take vpon you the yoake of Chriſt, you muſt permitt your ſelfe to be exerciſed in all ſuch things as Obedience shall thinke fitt to impoſe.</hi> To this he anſweared; <hi>that as the iron in the hand of the Smith, is ſubiect to whatſoeuer he will doe therewith, So will I, ſayth he, O Father, ſubmitt my ſelfe to what ſoeuer you shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund me. I will then ſaith the other that thou contynue at the gate of the Monaſtery, and that thou caſt thy ſelfe downe at the feete of all them whoe either enter in or goe out, and deſire them to pray to God for thee, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe thou art a great ſinner.</hi> He performed it punctually, and when he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeauen yeares in this exerciſe, and obteyned great <hi>Humilitie,</hi> by this meanes, the Abbot reſolued to take him into the Monaſtery, in company of the reſt, and to make him Preiſt as one who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued that honour. But he imploying many interceſſors, and in particular

                  <hi>Sainct Iohn Climacus</hi> himſelfe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he at length obteyned of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, that he ſhould leaue him in the fame exerciſe, and place wherein he had formerly liued, till he ſhould finiſh his courſe; as ſignifying, or at leaſt coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that now the day of his death was not farr of. And indeede, iuſt ſoe it proued for ten dayes after this, our lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take him to himſelfe. And ſeauen dayes after that, God alſoe tooke the porter of the ſame Monaſtery, to whome the former had promiſed, whilſt he was yet aliue, that if, when he were dead, he ſhould haue any power with Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, he would procure that the other might come quickly to keepe him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſoe it fell out. The ſame ſaynt affirmes moreouer, that when the man was yet aliue, and beſtowed himſelfe vpon that exerciſe of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> he asked him vpon what he was wont moſt to thinke, at that tyme, to this he anſwered that his exerciſe was, to hould himſelfe vnworthie of the conuerſation of them in the Monaſtery, and of the ſight and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Fathers; yea and euen to lift vp his eyes, to looke vpon them.</p>
               <p>It is recorded in the liues of the Fathers,

Then another Philoſopher there, putting cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine affronts vpon ſuch as came in to heare him the firſt tyme, to ſee if they would haue patience, and this ſcholler falling out in a laughter, after a ſcorne which the other had put vpon him: he ſaid, What, doſt thou laugh whilſt I am vſing thee ill? To this the ſcholler an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared, For three yares together I gaue preſents to ſuch as did me wronge and finding now, that I am ill vſed without cauſe, would you not haue me laugh.

Our Father, ſtood ſtill with much ioy, but Father Lainez asking him why he went not on, and why he left not the boy, our Father anſueared thus. Why ſhould wee depriue this boy of that contentment, and delight which he is takeing; and ſoe he ſtaid ſtill, that the youth might haue his fill in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and laughing and reſting at him: he receiuing more guſt therein, then worldly men are wont to doe, in acquiring eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and honour.</p>

alſo leſſe ſufficient then the Monaſticall, for the obteyning of the vertues, which are neceſſary, in regard that it wants the vſe and exerciſe thereof. For how ſhall he exerciſe Humilitie, who hath noe man to whome he may humble himſelfe? and how can he exerciſe the vertue of mercy, and Charitie, whoe hath noe entercourſe, or communication with any other? and how can he exerciſe patience who hath no man to reſiſt his will? But now, the Religious man who liues in communitie, hath great meanes for the obteyning of all neceſſary vertue, through the many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fould occaſion, which he hath to liue in the exerciſe of them all. Of Humilitie becauſe he hath ſome body to whome he may humble, and to whom he may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect himſelfe. Of Charitie, becauſe he hath ſome body, vpon whome he may ſhew it. Of Patience becauſe he who liues in company of many, will not faile to haue occaſions for the exercice thereof, and in the ſame manner, might we goe diſcourſing of all the other vertues.

And though it be true, that this was ordayned for other ends, as wee will ſhew afterward in the right place, yet there can be no doubt, but that it is a great exerciſe of Humilitie.

And generally, the vſe and exerciſe of all the exteriour penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and mortifications, which are vſed in the Society, aſſiſt much towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning, and conſeruing of true Humilitie; as namely the kiſſing of feete, the eating vnder the table, or els vpon the knees; or els lying proſtrate, croſſe the doore of the Refectory, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If theis things be done with that ſpiritt which is required, they will be of great vſe, to the getting and keeping of true Humilitie.

contynued ſeauen yeares at the gate of that Monaſtery, whereof we ſpake in the laſt Chapter: for by this meanes they will be of much profitt to you, and wil breede <hi>Humility</hi> in the very rootes of the hart.

For as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>Corporalis exercitatio, ad modicum vtilis eſt.</hi> It is to doe things but by way of complement, and for cuſtome, when they are onely done exteriourly, without ſpiritt, and with out procuring to obtaine that end, which is deſired the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby. If you obtaine ſoe much of your ſelues, as to kiſſe the feete of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to proſtrate your ſelues to the end that they may tread vpon you, and afterward you will yet ſpeake inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and harſhly to them, the one ſutes not well with the other, and it is a ſigne, that you did the former either for compliment or with hipocriſie.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other exerciſes of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie</hi> haue wee in the <hi>Societie,</hi> according to our <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions.</hi> And I thought fitt to bring them heere to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, though we pointed at them before to another purpoſe: that ſoe we may ſtill
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7498:122"/>
place our eyes, vpon them, and lett this be that, wherein wee cheefely exerciſe <hi>Humilitie.</hi> For that wherein a Religious man is cheefely to exerciſe an expreſſe virtue and mortification, is the exact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of the Rules, and Conſtitutions of his owne Order, thus in that, wherein your profitt and perfection conſiſts. And if you haue not vertue, to put thoſe things in execution, concerning <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and mortification, to which you are obliged by your Inſtitute, and Rule, whatſoeuer you haue els, is worth nothing. And the like we may ſay alſoe of euery Chriſtian; namely, that ſince the principal cauſe why he hath neede of Humility and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is for the performing of the law of God, if he haue it not, to this end, it will doe him little or noo good. If he haue not Humility and mortification, enough, to confeſſe a ſinne which may put him to ſhame; but that through baſhfullnes, or to ſpeake more plainely, through pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, he will breake ſoe principall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, what profitt will he reape by what ſoeuer he either hath or doth, ſince for this alone, he ſhal be damned. Soe may we alſoe ſay, in ſome ſort, of the Religious man. If you haue not <hi>Humilitie</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:7498:123"/>
enough to diſcouer your conſcience to your Superiour, &amp; to comply with ſoe principall a Rule as this, for what ſerues your <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and mortification? If you cannot yet endure, that another ſhould acquainte the Superiour with any fault of yours, to the end that he may reforme you, where is your Humilitie? If you want <hi>Humilitie,</hi> wherewith to take a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hention, and the penance of performing ſome poore, and meane charge, and to be incorporated in that very degree, into which the Society inclines to put you, for what ſerues <hi>Humilitie,</hi> or indifferency, and to what end ſhould your Superiours deſire it? And thus euery Religious man may ſpecifie in the particular Rules of his Order, and euery other man, in all thoſe particulars, which his condition or vocation may require.</p>

in any kinde, to your owne praiſe, for it is very daungerous, though you could ſay it with much truth, &amp; though it might be matter of aedification; and though you may thinke it be to a good end, and for the profitt of another, yet it ſuffices that it is to your owne praiſe, to keepe you from ſpeaking it. You muſt euer walke with great care concerninge this, leaſt otherwiſe by this meanes, you looſe the good which perhaps you did.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Bonauenture</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nunquam de ſcientia vel de ſeculi ſtatu ſe iactent.</hi> You muſt neuer ſpeake word which may giue others to vnderſtand, that you haue emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts, or that you were formerly of ſome acounte in the world. It lookes very ill fauouredly in a Religious man, to value himſelfe by the nobilitie, and riches of his freinds; for all theis pedegrees, and ſtates, are no better then a little winde: and, as one asked, <hi>Doe you knowe for what Nobilitie is good?</hi> the other anſwered very well, <hi>To be deſpiſed, as wealth is.</hi> That whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof we make accounte heer, is the vertue of <hi>Humilitie</hi> which you haue, this is that which wee eſteeme: for what you were, or were not before you came hither, is all but ayre, and he whoe values himſelfe by

theis things, or makes accounte thereof, in a Religious ſtate, ſhewes abundantly his little Spirit, and how vaine a hart he hath, Such a man as this, hath not yet for ſaken, or deſpiſed the world.

And ſo proſtratinge then them ſelues all in prayer, they roſe not till the ſicke man was reſtored to his health.

               <p>To the end that wee may profitt the more, by this meanes in our Prayer, and that therein, this vertue may imprint it ſelfe the more deepely in our harts we muſt goe deſcending to thoſe particular, and hard caſes which may ocurre: and we muſt animate our ſelues, and actuate vpon them, as if we had them preſent then: inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and deteyinge our ſelues therein, till at length no one thinge may be able to putt it ſelfe before vs which we cannot make plaine and ſmooth. For by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vice will come to be rooted vp, and vertue will be ſincking, and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſelfe into the very roote of the hart, &amp; perfecting it ſelf dayly more and more. That is a very good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: which the Goldſmiths vſe for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyning of God: they melt it, in the chryſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and when it is melted they caſt a grai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of <hi>Sublimate</hi> in to it, and then the gold begins to boyle vp with great heigth and fury, till the <hi>Sublimate</hi> bee ſpent: for then the gold begins to be quiet.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7498:130"/>
The gold ſmith comes againe, and caſts in another graine of Sublimate and the gold boyles vp againe but not with ſoe much ſtrength as before, and when that Sublimate is alſo ſpent, the gold lyes ſtill. They caſt in Sublimate a third tyme, and the gold boyles againe, but gently now, and finally he caſts in more Sublimate the fowerth tyme; but then the gold makes noe noyſe or alteration at all, any more then if they had caſt nothing in, and then the gold is perfectly refined, and this is the ſigne thereof.</p>
               <p>Now this is that very thing which we muſt be doeing in prayer; namely, to caſt in a graine of Sublimate, imagining that ſuch a particular mortification or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, is then offering it ſelfe to vs: and if it beginne to trouble and ſtinge vs, we muſt detaine our ſelues therein, till the heate and feruour of our prayer, conſume that graine of Sublimate, and till we be able to make head againſt it and finde our harts quiet, and repoſed therein. And the next day caſt in another graine of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimate, imagininge that ſome other matter of difficulty, and of much morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and humiliation is offering it ſelfe; and if ſtill your nature be troubled
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7498:130"/>
and offer to boyle vp, detaine your ſelues therein, till it be ſpent and you be quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Then caſt in another, and yet another graine, as occaſion ſerues, and when now the Sublimate makes noe noyſe nor breedes noe trouble to you, but that whatſoeuer occaſion may be offered and repreſented to you, yow ſtill remaine with much quietnes and peace, the gold is then purified, and refined, and this may ſerue you for a ſigne, of hauinge obteyned the perfection of this vertue.</p>

And this diligence is to be vſed by vs, till the works be performed by vs in ſuch forte, as that we may rather ſeeme to be loueing God in them, then to be workeing of them, as wee declared formerly at large, when wee treated of the rectitude, and puritie of the intention, which we are to carry in our actions.</p>
               <p>The fowerth pointe, vpon which wee may carry our <hi>particular examination,</hi> is, not to excuſe our ſelues. For this alſoe growes from pride, when comitting a fault and being tould of it, we inſtantly make our excuſe, and, without euen marking it, wee make one excuſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metymes vpon another, yea and wee will yet giue another excuſe, for hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly excuſed our ſelues: <hi>Ad excuſand as excuſationes in peccatis.</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> vpon theis words of Iob. <hi>Si abſcondi, quaſi homo, peccatum meum, &amp; caelaui in ſinu meo, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatem meam. If as a man, I haue hidden my ſinne,</hi> the Saint ponders theis words very well <hi>Quaſi homo, as a man:</hi> and ſaith, <hi>that it is the propertie of a man, to deſire to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:7498:134"/>
couer and excuſe his ſinne, becauſe it comes to vs by deſcent, from our firſt parents.</hi> As ſoone as the firſt man had ſinned, he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to hide himſelfe amongſt the trees of Paradiſe, and God reprouing him for his diſobedience, he thus excuſed himſelfe preſently vpon his wife: <hi>Mulier quam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſti mihi ſociam, dedit mihi de ligno, &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medi. O Lord, that woman, whome thou gaueſt me for my companion, made me eate of the forbidden fruite.</hi> And the woman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed her ſelfe in like manner, vpon the ſerpent: <hi>Serpens decepit me, The Serpent deceiued me and I did eate thereof.</hi> God exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined them about their ſinne, to the end that knowing it, and confeſſing it, they might obtaine pardon for it: and ſoe Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, that he did not axamine the Serpent, becauſe he meant not to pardon the Serpent. But they, inſteede of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them ſelues, and acknowledging their ſinne, towards the obteyning of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, increaſe and agrauate it, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes: yea and by deſiring, after a ſorte, thus to caſt the fault vpon God. <hi>The woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome thou gaueſt me, O Lord, was the cauſe.</hi> As if he had ſaid: If thou hadſt not giuen her me for a companion, no part of this had bene done. The ſerpent which thou
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7498:135"/>
didſt create, and ſuffer to enter into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, deceiued me, and if thou hadſt not ſuffred it to enter there, I had not ſinned. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, that they hauing heard from the diuells mouth, that they ſhould be like God, ſince they could not become like him in the pointe of his diuinitie, they endeauoured to make him like them, in the pointe of their ſinne, &amp; ſoe they made it greater by defending it, then they had done by comitting it. And now, as being Children of ſuch parents, and in fine, as being men, we ſtill remaine with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, and with this defect, and ill cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and when we are reproued for any fault, we inſtantly haue a minde to couer it with an excuſe, as vnder bowes and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: yea and ſome tymes, a man is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to excuſe himſelfe, but he muſt needes be caſting the fault vpon others. A Saint compares ſuch as excuſe themſelues, to the hedge-hogge; which when it perceiues that they goe about to take her, ſhee ſhrinks in her head and feete with extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſpeede and remaines as a bowle, being circled on euery ſide as it were with thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; ſoe that a man cannot touch her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pricking himſelfe firſt. <hi>Vt prius videas ſanguinem tuum quam corpus ſuii: Soe that you
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:7498:135"/>
shall ſooner ſee your owne blood, then her body.</hi> In this manner, ſaith, the S. be they whoe are wont to excuſe themſelues; for if you wil but thouch them, by telling them the faults which they made, they inſtantly defend themſelues like the hedgehog; and ſome tymes they pricke and gaule you, and giue you alſo to vnderſtand, that you as wel deſerue reproofe. At other tymes, they will be telling you, that there is a <hi>Rule</hi> which forbids one to finde faulte with another; and at others, that there be ſome whoe make greater faults which yet men are content to diſſemble; and in fine, doe but touch the hedgehogge, and you ſhall ſee whether he will pricke you or noe. All this buſines growes from our great pride, whoe would not haue our faults knowne, nor be held for defectiue, and it troubles vs more, that they be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and for the eſtimation which wee thinke yee looſe thereby, them for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing committed them; and ſoe we procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to conceile, and hide them, the moſt we can. Nay there are ſome ſoe vnmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in this kinde, that euen before you ſay any thing, they preuent you and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelues, and giue reaſons for that which they thinke you may obiect; and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7498:136"/>
they ſay, <hi>If I did this, it was for this reaſon and if I did that, it was for that:</hi> and the like. But whoe, in the meane tyme, pricks you now, that you muſt skipp ſoe high? The goade of pride it is, which you carry ſoe deepely rooted in your harts. This is that which pricks you, and which makes you leape euen before your tyme. It will the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore be well done by him whoe findes this old and ill cuſtome in himſelfe, to examine himſelfe particularly thereof; till at length, he may come to parte with all deſire of couering his faults; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſince he committed them, lett him be gladd to be held faulty, in recompence and ſatisfaction thereof. Yea and though you haue made noe faulte, and yet they reprehend you as if you had, yet doe not you excuſe your ſelues. For when the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour ſhall haue a minde to know the cauſe or reaſon, which you had for doeing it, he can aske you the queſtion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs he knowes it already: and deſires but to make tryall of your <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and to ſee in what manner you take the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and reprehenſion which he giues.</p>
               <p>The fifth, is alſoe very good for a man to examine himſelfe vpon, namely the reſtrayning and cutting of all thoughts
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7498:136"/>
of pride. A man is ſoe proud, and vaine, that many idle and presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptious thoughts, will be ruſhing in vpon him, and he will imagine himſelfe to be in ſome high offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and performing of ſome great fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Already you fancy your ſelues to be preaching in the places where you were borne, with great allowance &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge, and you imagine that you produce great fruite. Already doe you conceiue that you are reading, or diſputinge againſt ſuch Concluſions, with great applauſe of the hearers; and ſuch things as theis. All this growes from our great pride, which lyes ſpronting, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge out into theis thoughts. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it will be very well done, to make a particular examination vpon the clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and cutting of theis thoughts, which are ſoe haughtie and vaine. And ſoe will it be fitt ſo to ſtopp &amp; inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cutt off all impure though s, and raſh iudgments, or any other vice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby we may finde our ſelues to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted.</p>
               <p>The ſixt pointe ſhall be, to carry a particuler examination vpon your ſelues, whether you eſteeme of all men as your Superiours, according to what our Rule
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7498:137"/>
ſaith, Namely that we muſt animate our ſelues, towards <hi>Humility,</hi> by procuring and deſiring to giue the adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage to others eſteeminge them all from our very ſoules, as if they were our Superiours, and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly bearing them that reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, which the condition or ſtate of euery one of them ſhall beare with plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenes and Religious ſimplicitie of hart: and this is alſoe taken from the Apoſtle. And how ſoeuer there is to be a difference amongſt men, according to the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their perſons and ſtates, yet, for as much as may concerne the interiour and true <hi>Humilitie</hi> of our ſowles, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will is that as this Society was called by him <hi>the leaſt</hi> of all other religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſoe euery member thereof, muſt hould himſelfe for the leaſt of them all and muſt hould them all for his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours and betters. This ſhall therefore be a very good, and profitable examination: but yet ſoe, as that it be not onely ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue, but that in the exerciſe and practiſe thereof we procure to carry our ſelues ſoe towards all, with ſuch <hi>Humilitie</hi> and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as if they were indeede our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours. For if you eſteeme that other man as your Superiour, you will not be tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7498:137"/>
to him with ſuch libertie, and harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and much leſſe in words which may mortifie and offend him, nor will you ſoe eaſily paſſe your iudgment raſhly vpon him, nor be diſguſted that he ſhould treate you, or ſpeake to you in this or that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And ſo you are to ſett downe, and note all theis things for faults, when you examine your ſelfe there vpon.</p>
               <p>The ſeauenth thing whereof we may particularly examine our ſelues, vpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of you as of others? Examine your ſelues whether you make good vſe of theis, as alſoe thoſe other occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which ſome tymes preſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, redounding to your diſeſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is one of the moſt proper, and moſt profitable examinations, which, wee can vſe towards the obteyning of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Humilitie.</hi> For beſides that we ſhall thus goe prouiding our ſelues, for all thoſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7498:138"/>
things which may dayly occurre, and whereof we may ſtand in neede, we may, by meanes of this examination, goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, and ryſing vp by thoſe three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of vertue, which we ſett downe before. Firſt, you may examine, whether or noe you carry all theis things with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Secondly whether you carry them with ſoe much promptitude and facility, as that they put you to noe trouble. And thirdly, whether you carry them with ioy, and with takeing pleaſure in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of your ſelfe; for in this wee ſhewed before, that the perfection of <hi>Humilitie</hi> doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>The eight pointe vpon which a man may particularly examine himſelfe, either in this ſubiect, or in others like it, is to make ſome acts, or exercices, as well inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour as exteriour of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> or any other vertue, about which he examines himſelfe, actuating vpon it, ſo many tymes in the morninge, and ſoe many in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge: begining with fewer acts, and ſo riſing vp to more, till at length he gett the habit and cuſtome of that vertue. And now the enemies being deuided after this manner, and we takeinge euery one of them by himſelfe, they will the more eaſily
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7498:138"/>
be ouercome, and the victory which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, will be the more ſpeedily obtained.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
               <p>THere is a doubt, wont to be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded concerninge <hi>Humilitie,</hi> the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof doth much import, that ſoe wee may knowe how to carry, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct our ſelues therein. Wee ordinarily ſay, and it is the general doctrine of the SS. that we muſt deſire to be abaſed, diſeſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and deſpiſed, and that men may hould vs in noe accounte. But then inſtantly it comes to be conſidered, on the other ſide, how wee ſhall be able to gather fruite, by the good of our neighbours, if they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme and deſpiſe vs: for to that end it is neceſſary that we haue a kinde of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with them, &amp; that they may hould vs in good opinion and eſtimation: and therefore it may ſeeme, that it ſhall not be ill but good, that wee deſire to be
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7498:139"/>
valued, and eſteemed by men. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> treate vpon this doubt very well, and ſay, that although it be true that we muſt fly from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and eſtimation of the world, by reaſon of the great danger which is the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, and that, for as much as is on our part, and for that which may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne our ſelues, we muſt euer deſire to be diſeſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and deſpiſed, yet for ſome good end of the greater ſeruice of God, the honour, and eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, may lawfully and piouſly be deſired. And <hi>S. Bernard</hi> ſaith alſoe, that for as much as concernes our part, we muſt wiſh that men may thinke, and eſteeme of vs as wee thinke and eſteeme of our ſelues, that ſoe they may value vs as our ſelues doe: but yet he ſaith withall, that it is not fitt many tymes that others ſhould be ſure thereof and ſoe therefore that wee may ſome tymes euen lawfully, and vertuouſly procure that they may not know our faults, leaſt ſo themſelues may receiue hurt thereby, through the hinderance of their owne ſpirituall good. But in the meane tyme, it will be neceſſary that we vnderſtand this pointe very well, and that wee
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7498:139"/>
walke therein, with greate caution, and with much ſpiritt, becauſe ſuch truthes as this, inſteede of doeing good, doe many tymes much hurt to ſome, whoe know not how to make right vſe thereof. The Saints themſelues declare this doctrine very well, that ſoe we may not take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of errour from thence. Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> ſaith <hi>Non numquam etiam ſancti viri de bona ſua opinione gaudent: ſed cum per hanc, ad meliora proficere audientes penſant. Sometymes euen holy men are gladd that they haue good opinion, &amp; eſtimation a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongst men; but this happens when they finde that it is a neceſſary meanes, for the doinge good and giuing helpe to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſoules. Nec iam de opinione ſua, ſed de proximorum gaudent vtilitate, quia aliud est fauores quaerere &amp; aliud de profectibus exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare. And this</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Gregory) is not to reioyce at his owne credit, or estimation; but for the fruite and good of his neighbours;</hi> Which is a very different caſe. It is one thing for a man to loue humaine honour, and eſtimation for it ſelfe, and to dwell as it were therein, for his owne reſpect, and contentment that ſoe he may growe great and be celebrated amongſt men, and this is naught, but another thing it is, when
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:7498:140"/>
this is liked for ſome good end, as for the good of our neighbours, and to giue hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe to ſowles, and this is not ill but good, and thus wee may well deſire opinion, and eſtimation of the world, and that they may haue vs in good conceite, for the greater glory of God, and becauſe it may be neceſſary for the edification of our neighbours, and for the benefitt of their ſowles. For thus a man ſhall not reioyce in his owne honour, and eſtimation, but in the ſpirituall good of others, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory of Almightie God. And as he whoe for his health deſires to take a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, which he naturally abhorrs, may well ſay, that to admitt and like the purge, is to loue his health; ſoe he who admitts, and likes humaine honor, which otherwiſe he deſpiſes (onely becauſe in that caſe it is a neceſſary, or at leaſt a profitable meanes for the ſeruice of God, and the good of ſowles) may affirme with truth, that he deſires and likes nothing in it, but the glory of almighty God.</p>
               <p>But lett vs now conſider how we may know, whether a man delight in honour, and eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the meere glory of God, and the good of his neighbours, or els for his owne ſake and for the affection which
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7498:140"/>
he beares to his owne honour: fort this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is a nice pointe, wherein the whole difficultie of this buſines co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts S. <hi>Gregory</hi> anſwered thus: <hi>Qua inre neceſſe eſt, vt cum audientium vtilitati non proficit, mentem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtram fama laudabilis non eleuet, ſed fatiget, Our being gladd of honour and eſtimation, is to be ſo meerely for God, that when it is not neceſſary for his greater glory, and the good of ſowles, not onely we are not to reioyce therein, but to be troubled at it.</hi> So that our deſire and harte, for as much as may depend on vs, is euer to be inclined to diſhonour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and therefore when any occaſion thereof is preſented, we muſt embrace it with our whole harts, and be gladd of it as men, whoe haue mett with what they wiſhed for. And as for honour and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, we are onely to deſire it, and be gladd thereof, ſoe farre forth as it may be neceſſary for the edification, and further good of our neighbours ſoules, and for the greater honour and glory of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God. Wee reade of our bleſſed <hi>Father Ignatius</hi> that if he had giuen way to the feruour of his owne deſire, he would haue bene glad to goe through the ſtreetes, all ſtucke with feathers, and full of Durt: that ſoe he might be held
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7498:141"/>
for a madd foole, but that the Charitie and deſire, which he had of the good of ſowles, had repreſſed this ſoe ardent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, which carryed him towards the acts of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and put him into the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of treating himſelfe with ſuch decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grauity, as might be fitt for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and perſon. But as for his deſire and inclination, it was euer to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and a baſed: and whenſoeuer any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was offered, whereby he might humble himſelfe, he imbraced it, and when it was not offered he ſought it, with great deſire to finde it. By this you ſhall therefore know, if you be gladd of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and eſtimation, for the good of ſoules, and the glory of God, or els for your owne honour and fame. If when any occaſion of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and contempt is offered, you imbrace it in good earneſt, and with the heart; and if you reioyce thereat, it is then a good ſigne; that when ſuch a ſermon, or ſuch another imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath ſucceeded well, and that you are valued and eſteemed for it, you reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce not for your owne honour, and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but meerly for the glory of God, and the good of ſoules which growes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. But when, on the other ſide ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and of being held in ſmall accounte is offered, you reiect it, or you carry it not well; and if when it is not neceſſary for the good of others, you will yet be gladd of eſtimation and praiſe of men, and procure alſoe to haue it, this indeede is a ſigne, that you are gladd alſo in thoſe other things, as for a thinge which hath relation to your ſelfe, and your owne eſtimation and honor, and not meerely for the glory of God, and the good of ſowles.</p>
               <p>Soe that it is true, that the honour and eſtimation of men, is not ill but good, if we vſe it rightly, and it may lawfully and vertuouſly be deſired as when <hi>Father Franciſcus Xauier,</hi> went to the king of Bungo, with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and grauitie. Yea euen a mans prayſing himſelfe, maybe holy and good, if it be done as it ought. And ſo wee ſee that Saint Paule writing to them of Corinthus, began to praiſe, and recounte great things of himſelfe, relating the high fauours which our Lord had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to him; and ſaying, <hi>That he had laboured more then the rest of the Apoſtles:</hi> Yea and he began to tell them <hi>of his reuelations, and rapts, whereby he
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7498:142"/>
had bene carryed vp to the third heauen.</hi> But all this he did, becauſe it was conuenient, Yea and neceſſary for the glory of God, and good of them to whome he wrote; that ſoe they might growe to hould and value him for an Apoſtle of Chriſt, and embrace his doctrine, and take benefitt thereby: and he ſpoke theis things of himſelfe, with a hart, which did not onely deſpiſe honour, but loue diſhonour, for the loue of Chriſt our lord, and when his honour was not neceſſary for the good of others, he knew, very well how to empty and a baſe himſelfe, ſaying: <hi>That he was not worthie to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe he had perſecuted the Church of God;</hi> and ſtyling himſemfe <hi>blaſphemous, and abortiue, and the greateſt of ſinners;</hi> and when the occaſions of diſhonour and contempt were preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, therein was his contentment and ioy. Such harts as theis, we may well truſt with receiuing honour, and with ſaying ſometymes, ſuch things as may conduce towards it; becauſe they will neuer doe it, but when it may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the greater glory of God, yea and euen then, they doe it ſoe much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſticking of any part thereof to themſelues, as if they had not done it
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7498:142"/>
it at all: for they loue not their owne honor, but the honour of Almightie God, and the good of Sowles.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it is a matter of much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to receiue honor, and not to growe proud by it, nor to take any vaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or complacence therein: therefore the SS. through their feare of the great danger which lur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

S. <hi>Francis</hi> ſaid very well, I am not a Religious man, if I take not diſhonour, with the ſame both inward and out ward ioy, where with I take honour. For if I ioy in that honour which others allowe me, when I preach, or performe any other office of Charitie to them, for their good; (whereby yet I put my ſoule to runne ſome hazard, through the daunger of vanitie) much more ought I ioy in mine owne good, and in the ſaluation of mine owne ſowle;
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7498:143"/>
which I preſerue with more ſecurity, when I am ſcorned; and it is euident that wee are more obliged to ioy in our owne good and profitt, then in that of others, becauſe <hi>Charitie well ordered beginnes at home.</hi> If then you ioy in the good of your neighbour, when the ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment hath ſucceeded well, and when you are eſteemed and prayſed for it, why ſhould you not be gladd of your owne good, when you hauing done what was in you, are yet vndervalued for your paine for this is better and more ſafe for you? If you be gladd when you haue a great tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, wherewith to doe great things, for the good of others, why are you not glad of you owne good, and for your being left in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, becauſe God gaue you no ſuch tallent? If you be gladd when you haue much health and ſtrength, wherewith to labour hard for the good of others; why ſhould you not be glad when God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that you ſhould be ſicke and weake, and be fitt for nothing, but to be layd by in a corner and without vſe: for this is your profit, and this will helpe you more towards <hi>Humilitie;</hi> and in this ſhall you pleaſe God more, then if you were a great preacher, ſince his will is ſoe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:7498:143"/>Heerby it may be ſeene, how much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued they are, who haue lodged theyr eyes vpon honour, and the eſtimation of the world, vnder colour, forſooth, that is neceſſary for the doeing good to others: and vnder this pretence they deſire high place, and honourable imployments, and all that which lookes like greatnes, and ſoe they fly from all that which is meane, and poore: for they make them ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that they were to be diſauthoriſed thereby. But in this is another deceipt, and a very greate one, that by the very thing, whereby a man pretends to gaine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and by that whereby he thought to looſe it, he ſhall gaine it. Some conceiue, that by meanes of the poore coate, and by exerciſeing that low and meane place, they ſhall looſe that value, and eſtimation, which were neceſary for the doeing good to others, but it is their pride which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues them: for they ſhould rather gaine it by this meanes: and by the contrary of that whereby they would procure it, they ſhall looſe it. Our Bleſſed Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> taught this doctrine very well, and was wont to ſay, that the ſtudy of true <hi>humility</hi> did more helpe to the conuerſion of ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, then the being in authoritie or ſtate

which hath in it, any ſmacke or ſent of the wordly honour. And he practiſed this not onely in himſelfe, but he taught it in ſuch ſort to them whome he ſent to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the vineyard of our lord, that to the end that they might ſucceede, in the doeing of high, and greate things, they muſt euer procure to walke in the way of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> &amp; contempt of them ſelues: for then would the worke be ſafe, as being well funded vpon <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and beſides, for that this is the way, whereby our lord is wont to doe great things. And according heere vnto, when our B.

And now after all this, will it be fitt that we ſhould goe doubting, and fearinge, and dreaming on, with our humaine pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: leaſt reputation forſooth, ſhould be loſt, by ſuch actions as theis.

               <p>But now laying this laſt reaſon which is the cheife a ſide, and to conſider the thing in queſtion, by the way of prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. and humaine reaſon, you cannot employ a more efficatious meanes to gaine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and opinion amongſt your neigbours, and to doe good to ſowles, then to exerciſe your ſelues in theis things, which ſeeme poore and baſe, &amp; to doe it ſoe much the more, by how much the more your parts are greater. The reaſon of this is, becauſe the world doth ſoe hugely eſteeme of honour and eſtimation, and of things which are high, in order to that end, as that the thinge of the whole world which it admires moſt, is the man who deſpiſes that, and to ſee that one whoe might be vſed in high and honorable imployments doth chooſe to paſſe his howers, in things which are pore and meane: and thus they grow to frame a great conceite, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſanctitie of ſuch perſons, &amp; accept of that doctrine which they teach, as if it came i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mediately to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:7498:145"/>Wee read in the life of Father <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Xauier,</hi> that when he was to embarke himſelfe for the Indyes, he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any prouiſion at all, for his nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Conde de <hi>Caſtaineda,</hi> who had then the office to prouide for the fleets of thoſe parts, being very earneſt with the Father, that at leaſt he would take ſome ſeruant with him, who might aſſiſt him at Sea, alledging that it would diminiſh his authoritie and reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with that people which he was to inſtruct by the way, if they ſhould ſee him, amongſt the reſt of the paſſingers, waſh his owne cloathes vpon the decks, and dreſſe his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, with his owne hands, the Father made him this anſwere. <hi>My lord, the procuring to gaine authoritie, and reputation by this very meanes, whereof your Lordshipp ſpeaks, hath betrayed the Church of God, and brought the prelates thereof, to that ſtate wherein now they are. And the meanes whereby this reputation is to be recouered muſt be to wash a mans owne raggs, and to dreſſe his owne meate, without hauing neede of any other, and in the midſt of all this, to be imploying himſelfe vpon the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of his neighbours, for the good of their ſoules.</hi> The Conde was ſoe edified with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that he knew not what to reply.

this meanes, &amp; by ſuch <hi>Humility</hi> and vertue as this, authoritie and creditt is to be gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and thus will you gather more fruite. And ſoe wee ſee what great things Father <hi>Franciſcus Xauier,</hi> did in the Indyes, by teaching Children the Chriſtian doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and by goeing about, and ringinge his little bell by night, to gett the ſowles in Purgatory prayd for: and by ſeruing and comforting the ſicke; and in fine, by imploying himſelfe in ſuch low, and meane actions as theis. And by this way, came he to be a man of ſoe much reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and authoritie, that he robd all men of their harts, and drew them towards him: and they eſteemed him and called him, <hi>the Holy Father.</hi> This is that kinde of authoritie, whereof men haue neede, that ſoe they may be able to doe good to ſowles: this is the eſtimation &amp; opinion, which followes hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble men, and belongs to Saints and Euangelicall preachers, and this in a word, is that which we are to procure. For as for thoſe other authorities, and reputations, and puntilies, which carry a ſmacke and ſauour of the world with them, they doe great hurt, and they diſedifie our neigbours very much, as well them whoe are a broade, as vs

               <p>Father <hi>Mafeus,</hi> in the Hiſtory of the Indies, relates how one of our Fathers preaching the Faith of Chriſt our lord, in <hi>Iapon,</hi> one of thoſe Pagans, who by chance paſſed by, at that tyme, in the publicque ſtreete of <hi>Firando,</hi> made a ſcorne both of his perſon, and of his preaching: and drawing vp as much fleame as he could, he ſpitt it full in the Fathers face. The preacher tooke out a handkircher, and wyped his face, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a word thereof, or ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any trouble at all; but proceeded in his ſermon with the ſame tenour and ſemblance, as if noe ſuch thinge had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The while, one of the auditors marckt it much, and ſeeing the great <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,</hi> and patience of the preacher, he began to thinke thus with himſelfe. It is
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7498:147"/>
not poſſible, but that the doctrine which teaches ſoe much patience, Humility, and conſtancie of minde, ſhould be from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Certainely this is Gods buſines. And this conſideration, made ſoe much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in him, that it was a motiue to his conuerſion, and ſoe he went after the preacher, vpon the end of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and beſought him that he might be inſtructed in the faith of Chriſt our lord, and ſoe be baptiſed.</p>

               <p>THE third degree of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> is when a man profeſſing great vertues, and guifts of God, and being in greate honour, and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, growes not at all proud thereby, nor attributes any thing to himſelfe; but referrs and aſcribes it all, to the true fountaine thereof, which is God, <hi>from whome euery good, and perfect guift proceedes.

This third degree of Humility,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Bonauenture) belongs, to high and perfect men: and by how much higher they are, ſo much the more low, doe they humble themſelues. That a man whoe is imperfect, and faulty, should know and eſteeme himſelfe for ſuch, is noe great matter. It is commendable, and good, but it is noe wonderfull thing, any more then it is, for the ſonne of a plough man, not to deſire to be held for the kings Sonne; or for a poore man for poore, or a ſicke man for ſicke: and that others may hould them for ſuch as they know themſelues to be: but that a rich man should accounte himſelfe poore, and the great man make himſelfe little, and ſee conforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to meane perſons, this indeede deſerues to be accounted ſtrange.</hi> The ſaynt therefore ſaith, that it is not to be wondred at, that a man whoe is imperfect and faulty, ſhould hould himſelfe for imperfect and faulty: nay rather it were to be wondred at, if being as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Humility of the great ones;</hi> that we may ſoe vnderſtand, that there is more difficultie, and perfection therein, then one would thinke. For a man to receiue great guifts of God, and to doe great things, and to giue God all the glory of all as he ought, without attributing any thinge to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and not to take any vaine content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, is a pointe of great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. To be honoured and prayſed for a S. and that noe part of ſuch honour, and eſtimation ſhould ſtike at all to the hart, any more then if he had done nothing, is a very hard thing, and there are few who attaine to it, and there is neede of much vertue for the performance thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that to conuerſe in the midſt of honour, and not to be at all toucht thereby, is like conuerſing much with beatifull woemen, and yet neuer to looke vpon them with vnchaſt eyes. It is a difficult, and a daungerous thing, and a man had neede of much vertue therein. For a man to clime ſoe high, and not to be giddy, he had neede be maſter of a good head. All men haue not a head, wherewith to walke on high, All the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells of heauen, <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and his conſorts had it not; and ſoe they grew giddy, and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7498:152"/>
proud, and fell downe into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Abiſſe of Hell For this they ſay was the ſinne of the Angells, that when God created them ſoe beautifull, and had inri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them with ſo many both naturall, and ſupernaturall guifts, <hi>In veritate non ſtetit: they remayned not in God;</hi> nor gaue him the glory of all, but would needes ſubſiſt in themſelues And yet not as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, that of themſelues they had theis things (for they knew well, that they all came from God, and that they depended vpon him, ſince they knew they were his creatures) but, as the Prophett Ezechiell ſaith, <hi>Eleuatum eſt cor tuum in decore tuo: They grew proud in their beautie,</hi> and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themſelues in thoſe guifts, which they had receiued of god, and tooke delight in them, as if they had poſſeſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and did not aſcribe or referre them all, to God, giuing him the honour and glory thereof: but they grew proud, and they exalted, and contented themſelues vainely in themſelues. So that, although with their vnderſtanding, they knew that the glory thereof was due to God, yet they robbed him of it, and tooke it to themſelues, with their will. By this tyme you ſee, that this degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> is not
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7498:152"/>
ſoe eaſy, as it ſeemed, ſince the Angells ſound it ſoe hard, that they fell from that height wherein God had placed them, becauſe they knew not how to conſerue themſelues therein. And now, if the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells had not heads wherewith to walke ſoe hight, but that they grew giddy, &amp; fell downe much more reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue we to feare, leaſt wee may faile, when we are rayſed and exalted into hight becauſe we men are ſoe miſerable creatures, that as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid ſaith, <hi>wee vanish euen like ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.

               <p>O how aptly, and how well did Chriſt our Lord admoniſh vs of this. The holy Ghoſpell relates, that haueing ſent his ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty two deſciples to preach, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him full of ioy, and being, as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re proud, of their miſſion, they ſaid thus to him: <hi>Lord we haue done wonderfull things, yea and the very Diuells themſelues, haue obeyed vs in thy name.</hi> But the Sauyour of the world anſweared them thus, with great
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7498:153"/>
ſeueritie. <hi>Videbam Satanam, ſicut fulgur, de coelo cadentem.</hi> Take heede of vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in your ſelues, and know, that Lucifer fell downe from heauen, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe in that high ſtate wherein he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the was vainely pleaſed with himſelfe, and with thoſe guifts and graces, which he had receiued, and did not aſcribe all to the honour, and glorie of Almightie God, as he ought, but would needes take it to himſelfe. Take heede, the like happen not to you: growe not vaine by reaſon of the great and wonderfull things which you doe in my name, and take noe vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in them. And now theis words, may alſo ſute with vs. Take heede you waxe not proud, in that great things are done by you, for the good of others, and many fowles are gayned by your meanes. Take heede you haue noe vaine contente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the applauſe and opinion of men, and in the much accounte they make of you.

               <p>WEe haue not yet ſufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wherein the third degree of <hi>Humilitie</hi> conſiſts; and therefore it will be fitt to goe on, that ſoe we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter put in execution, this being the thing at which we ayme. The Saints affirme, that this third degree of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> conſiſts in knowing how to diſtinguiſh betwene the gould of the graces &amp; benefitts which comes to vs from God, and the droſſe or miſery, where with we abound in our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and then to giue euery one his due: to God, that which is his, and to our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues that which is ours: and that this be done by execution, and practiſe, wherein the life of this whole buſines conſiſts. Soe that <hi>Humilitie</hi> doth not
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7498:154"/>
conſiſt in knowing ſpeculatiuely, <hi>that of our ſelues, we are good for nothing, and can effect nothing, and that all good things come to vs from God, and that it is he, whoe works the willinge, the beginning, and the ending in vs, through his free and gratious will as Saint Paul</hi> declares (for onely to know this ſpeculatiuely, which is declared to vs, by the holy Catholike Faith) is a very eaſy thing and all true Chriſtians knowe and beleeue it; but to know &amp; exerciſe it, in the way of practiſe, and to be ſoe grounded and ſetled in it, as if wee ſaw it with our eyes, and toucht and tooke it into our hands, this (as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith) is a moſt particular grace, and high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Almightie God. To proue this, he brings that paſſage of <hi>S. Paul, Nos autem non ſpiritum huius mundi accepimus, ſed ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum qui ex deo eſt, vt ſciamus quae a deo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata ſunt nobis. Wee haue not receaued the ſpiritt of this world, but the ſpiritt of God, to the end that wee may know, and feele the guifts which wee haue receiued from his hand.</hi> For a man to acknowledge, and euen feele the graces which hee hath receiued from God, ſoe purely, as to eſteeme them as meerely anothers, and to haue bene imparted, and to be enioyed by the meere
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7498:154"/>
liberallitie and mercy of Almightie God, is a moſt particular fauour, and guift of his: and the wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>that this is ſupreame wiſedome. Et vt ſciui quoniam aliter non poſſem eſſe continens, niſi deus det, &amp; hoc ipſum erat ſapientia, ſcire cuius eſſet hoc donum. And another tranſlation ſaith, Hoc ipſum erat ſumma ſapientia. To vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and know practically, that to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, is not a thinge which we are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, by our owne strength, and that noe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, or indeauour of our owne, is able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it: but that it is the guift of God, and that we muſt haue it from his hand, is a pointe of ſupreame wiſedome.</hi> So that, in this which S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, is a <hi>particuler grace, and guift of God,</hi> and which <hi>Salomon</hi> calles <hi>ſupreame wiſedome,</hi> conſiſts this third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Humilitie. Quid habes quod non ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepiſti, ſi autem accepisti, quid gloriaris quaſi non acceperis.</hi> What haue we, which we haue not receiued; it was none of ours, for of our ſelues We haue noe good thinge; and if wee haue receiued it, and that it were anothers, and none of ours, Why doe we glory, as if we had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, and as if it were properly our owne.</p>
               <p>This was the <hi>Humilitie</hi> of the SS. who
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7498:155"/>
with being inriched by the guifts, and graces of Almighty God, and with his hauing rayſed them vp to the very toppe of perfection, and thereby to honour and eſtimation, euen in this world, haue not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding held themſelues for vile, and baſe in their owne eyes, and their ſoules remayned ſoe deeply fixed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their owne meanenes, and miſery, as if they had poſſeſſed noe ſuch graces at all. There ſtucke not the leaſt vanitie to their harts, nor any ayre at all of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and eſtimation, which the world gaue them; for they knew well, how to diſtinguiſh betweene their owne, and that of others; &amp; ſoe they lookt vpon all thoſe guifts, graces, honour, and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as things extrinſecall to themſelues, and receiued from the hand of God; and to him they aſcribed, and gaue all the glory and praiſe thereof; themſelues remayning ſtill intire in the knowledge of their owne vnworthines, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, they could neither haue, nor doe any good thing. And from thence it alſoe came that though the whole world exalted them, they would neuer yet exalt themſelues, nor eſteeme themſelues one iott the more for that, nor did any litle breath thereof
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7498:155"/>
ſticke to their harts. But it ſeemed to them that theis praiſes were not vttered, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, but ſome other, to whome they belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged; namely God, in whome, &amp; in whoſe glory they placed all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and ioy. And thus it is affirmed with much reaſon, that this is the <hi>Humilitie</hi> of great, and perfect men. Firſt, becauſe it already preſupoſes great vertue, and great guifts of God, which onely makes one great in his fight, and ſecondly, becauſe in it ſelfe, for a man to be truly great in the ſight of God, and very eminent in vertue and perfection, and for that reaſon to be highly valued, and eſteemed, both before God and man, and yet in the midſt of all this to hould himſelfe for little and baſe in his owne eyes, is a great and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable perfection.</p>
               <p>And this is that which S. Chriſoſtome, and S. Bernard doe ſoe much wonder at in the Apoſtles, and others, who, with being ſoe great Saints, and ſo richly full of graces from God, and his Maieſtie working ſuch wonders and miracles by theyr meanes, ſo farr as euen to raiſe the dead themſelues to life, and being ſoe highly eſteemed for theis things, by the whole world, they yet neuertheles

remayned ſoe fixed in their vnworthines and baſenes, as if they had had nothing in them, and as if it had beene ſome other, and not they whoe wrought thoſe great things, and as if all that honor, and eſtimation and praiſe, were belonging to others, and as if they had imparted to others, and not to them. Saint Bernard ſaith: <hi>Non magnum eſt eſſe humilem in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectione, magna prorſus &amp; rara virtus, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militas honorata.</hi> It is not much that a man in pouertie and baſenes, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to humble himſelfe, for that which indeede he is, helpes him to know and diſeſteeme himſelfe, but that a man ſhould be generally honoured and eſteemed, and celebrated for an admirable man, and for a Saint, and yet remaine ſoe well grounded in the truth of his owne baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and of his <hi>Nothing,</hi> as if noe parte o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in another place, he ſaith, <hi>thas as our corporall eyes, though they be neuer ſoe sharpe ſighted, yet if they be not aſsiſted by the light of the Sunne, can diſcerne nothinge; ſoe a man, how much ſoeuer he may be iuſtified, cannot ſoe much as contynue to liue well, if he be not ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the light of God's grace. If our lord keepe not the Cittie, ſaith the Prophett Dauid, in vaine doth he watch who keepes it. O ſi cognoſcant ſe homines, &amp; qui gloriantur, in Domino glorientur,</hi> ſaith the Saint. O that men would at length know them ſelues, and now at length, vnderſtand them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues as to confeſſe that they haue nothing in them ſelues, whereof to glory, but onely in Almightie God. O that God would ſend vs ſome beame of light, from heauen, whereby we might apprehend and vnderſtand our owne darkenes: and that there is noe good, nor be eing, not ſtrength in any thing which euer was
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7498:158"/>
created, but onely ſoe farre forth, as our lord hath bene gratiouſly pleaſed to giue it, and is ſtill pleaſed to continue it. Now in this doth the third degree of <hi>Humilitie</hi> conſiſt, ſaueing that no poore words of ours can arriue to expreſſe the profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, and great perfection which is the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, notwithſtanding all that which we can ſay, ſometymes after one manner, and ſome tymes after another: and not onely is the practiſe heereof hard, but euen the ſpeculation alſoe.</p>
               <p>This is that anihillation of a mans ſelfe, which is ſoe often repeated, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Maſters of ſpirituall life. This is that houlding, and confeſſing a mans ſelfe for vnworthie, and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to all purpoſes. Which S. <hi>Benet</hi> and other Saints ſett downe, for the moſt perfect degree of <hi>Humility. Ad omnia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignum, &amp; in vtilem ſe confiteri, &amp; credere.</hi> This is that diſtruſt of a mans ſelfe, &amp; that being ſtill depending vpon God, which is ſoe recommended to vs in holy ſcripture. This is that houlding himſelfe in no accounte at all, whereof we are euer talking, and hearing: but O that we might finde it once for all in our very harts. That we might vnderſtand and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:7498:159"/>
feele, in very truth, and practically, as a man who ſees things with his eyes, and touches and feeles them with his hands, that, for as much as is on our part we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue any thing but miſery, nor can doe any thing but commit ſinne; and that all the good which wee effect, or worke, we neither exerciſe it, nor haue it of our ſelues, but onely of God; and that the honour and glory of all is his.</p>
               <p>And if with hauing ſaid all this, you yet vnderſtand not fully the perfection of this degree of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it; for this is a very high peece of Theologie; and therefore it is not ſtrange, though it be not ſoe eaſily vnderſtood. A certaine doctour ſaith very well, that it happens in all arts, and ſciences, that euery body arriues to know ſuch things as are common and plaine; but as for ſuch others as are curious and choiſe, they are not to be reached by euery hand, but by ſuch onely, as are eminent in that ſcience or arte. And iuſt ſoe it is in our caſe; for the ordinary and vſuall things, belonging to any vertue, are vnderſtood by all the world; but ſuch as are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and choiſe, and nice, and high, can onely be comprehended by ſuch as
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:7498:159"/>
are eminent, and fully poſſeſſed of that vertue. And this is that which S. <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Iustinianus</hi> ſaith, namely <hi>That noe man knowes well what Humilitie is but he who hath receiued the guift of being humble from God.</hi> And from hence it alſoe growes, that in reguard the ſaynts were indued with ſuch a moſt profound <hi>Humilitie,</hi> that they thought and ſaid ſuch things of themſelues, that we who fall ſo farr ſhort of them, cannot vnderſtand exactly what they ſay: but their ſpeeches ſeeme exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerations, as namely <hi>that they were the greateſt ſinners of the whole world,</hi> and the like, whereof I will ſpeake eare longe. But if we cannot ſay or thinke ſuch things as they, no nor euen vnderſtand them, it is becauſe we haue not arriued to ſoe great <hi>Humilitie</hi> as theirs was, and ſoe we vnderſtand not the curious, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till parts of this facultie. Procure you to be humble, and to grow vp in this ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and to profitt therein more and more, and then you will vnderſtand how ſuch things as thoſe, may be ſaid with truth.</p>

               <p>TO the end that we may yet better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this third degree of <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> and may ground our ſelues well the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein; it will be neceſſary for vs to goe backe, and take vp the matter neerer the fountaine. And as, according to what we ſaid before, all our naturall being, and all the naturall operations which we haue, we haue from God: becauſe we were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and then we had no power either to moue our ſelues, or to ſee, or heare, or taſt, or vnderſtand, or will: but God who gaue vs our naturall being, gaue vs theis faculties, and powers, and we muſt aſcribe our being, as alſoe theis naturall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to him; ſo in the ſelfe ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, and with much greater reaſon muſt we ſay, in the caſe of a ſupernaturall being and of the

works of grace, and that ſoe much more, as theis are greater, and more excellent then thoſe. We haue not our ſupernaturall being of our ſelues, but of God. In fine, it is a being of fauour and grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſoe called, becauſe out of his meere goodnes, hee added that, to our naturall being. <hi>Eramus natura filii irae.

And the cauſe why God did all this, was not for any reſpect either of our merits paſt, or ſeruices to come; but onely for his owne bounty, and mercy, and through the merits of Ieſus Chriſt, our onely Lord and Sauiour, as Saint Paule ſaith; <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficati gratis, per gratiam ipſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7498:161"/>
guift of God, and to him we muſt aſcribe it all without takeing the glory of it to our ſelues; ſoe could we neuer haue gone out of that darknes of ſinne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein we were, and in which we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and borne, if God of his infinite goodnes and mercy, hat not drawne vs out from thence, nor could we now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the works of ſpirituall life, if he gaue vs not his grace to that end. For the merit and worth of good works, growes not from that parte thereof, which they haue from vs, but from what they haue from the grace of our Lord, iuſt ſoe as the legall value which curra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t money hath, it hath not from it ſelfe, but from the ſtampe or coyne. And therefore we muſt not aſcribe any glory at all to our ſelues, but all to God, from whome both our Naturall, and ſupernaturall being is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued; carrying euer that of Sainct <hi>Paule,</hi> both in our mouthes, and in our harts, <hi>Gratiâ dei ſum, id quod ſum, I am whatſoeuer I am, by the meere grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, as according to what wee ſaid, God, not onely drew vs out of our <hi>nothing</hi> and gaue vs that being which now we haue; but after we are created, and haue receiued our being, wee doe not ſubſiſt in our ſelues, but God is euer ſuſteyning, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlding,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7498:161"/>
and conſeruinge vs, with his hand of prower, that ſoe we may not falle into that former profound Abiſte of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, from whence he tooke vs before, in the ſame manner is it alſoe, in the caſe of our ſupernaturall being; for not onely did God ſhew vs the fauour to bring vs out of the darkenes of ſinne, wherein we were, into the admirable light of his grace; but he is euer conſeruing, and houlding vs vp with his hand, that ſoe we may not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to fall. And this, to ſuch a proportion, as that if God ſhould take of his hand, of cuſtody from vs, but for one inſtant, and ſhould giue the diuell leaue to tempt vs then at his pleaſure; we ſhould returne both to our former, and to greater ſinnes: <hi>Quoniam à dextris eſt mihi, ne commouear</hi> ſaid the Prophett <hi>Dauid. Thou O Lord, art euer at my ſide houlding me vp, that I may not be pluckt downe;</hi> it is thy worke O Lord, to haue rayſed me vp from ſinne, thine to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue kept me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> returning to ſinne againe. If I roſe vp, it was becauſe thou gaueſt me thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; &amp; if now I be on foote, it is becauſe thou houldſt me from dropping downe.</p>
               <p>Since therefore, as we ſhewed it before to be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make vs hould our ſelues for <hi>nothing,</hi> becauſe, on our parte, wee are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, we were nothing, &amp; we ſhould be

nothing, if God were not euer conſeruing vs: ſoe this is alſoe ſufficient to make vs euer keepe our ſelues in the accounte of being Wicked ſinners, becauſe, for as much as is on our part, we are ſinners, we were ſinners, and we would be ſinners, if God were not ſtill vphoulding vs, with his holy hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> ſaith that who ſoeuer would obtaine <hi>Humility,</hi> muſt plant the roote thereof in his hart, which conſiſts in that he knew his owne weakenes and miſery, and vnderſtand, and weigh not onely how vile, and wretched he is now, but how vile and Wretched he may be, yea and would be euen very now, if God with his powerfull hand, did not keepe him, and ſinne a ſunder: and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the occaſions, and aſſiſt and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him in temptations. Into how many ſinnes had I fallne, if thou, O Lord, through thy infinite mercy, hadſt not kept me vp? how many occaſions of my ſinning haſt thou preuented, which were ſufficient to haue pulled me downe, as they pulled downe the Prophet <hi>Dauid:</hi> if thou, knowing my weakenes, if thou I ſay hadſt not hindred them?

How often haue I bene aſſaulted, and euen almoſt tripped vp, towards falling: and thou O Lord, didſt hould me, and didſt apply thy ſwete and ſtrong hand, that I might take noe hurt. <hi>Si dicebam motus eſt pes meus, miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia tua domine adiuuabat me. If I ſaid that my foote ſlippt, thy mercy O Lord, came to helpe me.</hi> O how often ſhould we haue bene loſt, if God, through his infinite mercy and goodnes, had not preſerued vs? This is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the acounte, wherein we are to hould our ſelues: becauſe this we are, and this we poſſeſſe on our parts, and this we were, and this we ſhould alſoe be againe, if God tooke of his hand, and cuſtodie from vs.</p>
               <p>From hence it came, that the SS. deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed humbled and confounded themſelues ſoe farre, that they were not content to eſteeme little of themſelues, and to hould
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7498:163"/>
that they were wicked, and ſinfull men; but they thought themſelues the meaneſt of all others, yea and the moſt vnworthie, and ſinfull men in the world. We read of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> that God had ſoe highly exalted him, and ſoe greately inriched him with ſpirituall graces, that his fellow or company on being in prayer, ſaw a chaire richly wrought with enamel, and pretious ſtones, and this, amongſt the Seraphins, which was prepared for him. And yet afterward, asking the Saint what opinion he had of himſelfe, his anſwere was, <hi>that he thought there liued not in the world a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinner then hee.</hi> And the ſame did the holy Apoſtle Saint Paule affirme alſoe, touching himſelfe: <hi>Chriſtus Ieſus venit in hunc mundum, peccatores ſaluos facere quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum primus ego ſum. Our lord Ieſus Chriſt came into this world to ſaue ſinners, of whome I am the firſt, or cheife.</hi> And ſoe he aduiſes vs to procure to obtaine this <hi>Humilitie</hi> that we hould our ſelues for inferiour, and leſſe then all others, &amp; that wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them all for our Superiours and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non fallit nos Apoſtolus nec adulatione vti iubet, cum ad Philippenſes</hi> 2. <hi>dicit, In humilitate ſuperiores, ſibi inuicem arbitrantes.</hi> Et ad Romanos 12.

                  <hi>Honore inuirem peruenientes; The Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaues vt not, when he ſaith that we muſt hould our ſelues for the leaſt of all, and that wee muſt eſteeme all others to be our Superiours and betters: and hee commaunds not heereby, that we should vſe any words of Flattery, or court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp towards them.</hi> The Saints did not ſay with counterfeite <hi>Humilitie,</hi> or telling a lye, that they were the greateſt ſinners of the world: but meerly according to truth, becauſe they thought ſoe in their very harts, and ſoe they alſoe giue vs in charge, that wee thinke and ſay the ſame, and this not by compliment, or with fiction.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ponders very well to this purpoſe, that ſaying of our B. Sauiour, <hi>Cum vocatus fueris ad nuptias, recumbe in nouiſsimo loco. When you shall be inuited, ſitt you downe in the laſt and loweſt place.</hi> Hee ſaid not, that you ſhould chooſe a middle place, or that you ſhould ſitt <hi>amongſt the loweſt;</hi> or in the laſt place but one: but he will onely haue you ſitt in the very loweſt place of all. <hi>Vt ſolus videlicet, omnium no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſsimus ſedeas, teque nemini, non dico prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas ſed nec comparare preſumas.</hi> Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are you not to preferre your ſelues before any, but not ſoe much as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to compare or equall your ſelues
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7498:164"/>
with any other: but you are onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the laſt place, without any equall in your baſenes, eſteeming your ſelues to be the moſt miſerable ſinners of the whole world. It puts you, ſaith he, to noe daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if perharps you ſhould humble your ſelues too much, and putting your ſelues vnder the feete of all; but the preferring your ſelues before any one alone, may put you to a great deale of preiudice. And he brings this ordinary compariſon. As when you paſſe by a low gate, the ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping too much with your head, can doe you noe hurt, but if you ſtoope neuer ſoe little leſſe then the gate requires, you may doe your ſelues ſoe much hurt as to brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke your heads; ſoe is it alſoe in the ſoule. For to abaſe and humble your ſelues too much, cannot be hurt full, but to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, to humble your ſelues, though it be but little to preferre or euen equall your ſelues to any one, is a dangerous thing. What knoweſt thou (O man) whether that one whome thou takeſt, not onely to be worſe then thou (for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs it ſeemes to thee now, that thou art growne to liue well) but that he is the wicked man and the greateſt ſinner in the whole world, may not proue perhaps a
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7498:164"/>
better man, then either they or thou, yea and that he is ſoe already in the ſight of God. Who knowes whether God will not change hands, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, and that the lotts will be alſoe changed; and that thou wilt come to be the forſaken, and the other choſen? <hi>Quid ſcis, ſi melior &amp; te, &amp; illis mutatione dexterae excelſae, in ſe quidem futurus ſit, in Deo vero iam ſit. How doe you know what God hatht wrought in that hart ſince yeſterday, yea and in this laſt minute. Facile eſt enim in oculis Dei ſubito ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtare pauperem.</hi> In one inſtant, is God able to make Apoſtles of a Publican, and a Perſecutor, as he did of Saint Matthew, and Saint Paule. <hi>Potens eſt Deus de lapidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus iſtis ſuſcitare filios Abrahae.</hi> Of ſinners more ſtonie and hard then a Diamond, can God make ſonns for himſelfe. How migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily did that Phariſe finde himſelfe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when he iudged Saint Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen for wicked, and when Chriſt our Lord reproued him, and gaue him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that ſhee whome he held for a publique ſinner, was better then hee.

Some of the Saints refuſe to anſwere the queſtion, how this may be; and content themſelues with beleeuing of themſelues, that they are ſoe in their harts. S. <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> relates; hat the Abbott <hi>Zoſimus</hi> being one day ſpeaking of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and ſaying ſoe of

And for him who is truly humble, and from the hart, it is a moſt eaſy thing to hould himſelfe in the loweſt and leaſt accounte of all others. For the truely humble man, conſiders in other men the goodnes and vertue which they haue, and in himſelfe he obſerues but his owne defects; and he is ſoe buſie and earneſt about the knowledge and redreſſe thereof, that he hath no leaſure to lift vp his eyes towards the faults of others, as conceaueing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to haue enough of his owne to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and ſoe he houlds all other men, for good, and himſelfe for wicked.

vertues, the knowing, deſpiſing, and humbling himſelfe doth alſoe increaſe, for all theis things goe together. And ſtill the more light he hath from heauen, and the more knowledge of the goodnes and Maieſtie of Almightie God, the more profound vnderſtanding will he come to haue of his owne miſery, and of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe <hi>Abyſſus abyſſum inuocat.</hi> That Abiſſe of the knowledge of the goodnes and greatnes of God, calls vp and diſcouers that other profound Abiſſe of our miſerie, and makes vs able to diſcerne the infinite little moates, and graines of duſt of our imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And if we hould our ſelues in any accounte, it is certainely becauſe we haue ſmalle knowledge of God, and little light from heauen. The beames of the Sunne of Iuſtice, haue not yet entred in by our window, and ſoe we doe not onely ſee not the moates which are our leſſe deffects, and imperfections, but we are ſoe ſhort ſighted, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede ſoe very blinde, that we ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our greater ſinnes.</p>
               <p>To this it may be added, that God loues <hi>Humilitie,</hi> in vs ſoe much, and it is ſo very pleaſing to him that we ſhould hould our ſelues in no accounte, and conſerue our
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7498:167"/>
ſelues therein; that, in order to this end, he is wont many tymes, in the caſe of his greate ſeruants, to whome he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts many high benefitts and fauours, to deſguiſe his guifts, and to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them in ſuch a ſecret and ſtraunge manner, that euen the man himſelfe who receiues them, doth not throughly comprehend them, and thinks they are nothing. Saint Ieroſme ſaith, <hi>Tota illa Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernaculi pulchritudo pellibus tegitur, &amp; ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciis: All that beauty of the Tabernacle, was couered with the skinnes, of beaſts.</hi> And ſoe vſeth God to conceale, and couer the beautie of mens vertues, and of his owne graces and benefitts; by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting variety of temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes of ſome errours, and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that ſoe they may be the more ſafely conſerued, as burning Coales vnder aſhes might bee.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Iohn Climacus</hi> ſaith, that as the diuell procures to lay our vertues, and good works before our eyes, that ſoe we may grow proud, becauſe he deſires our ruyne; ſoe on the contrary ſide, our lord God, becauſe he deſires our greater good, giues more particular light to his ſeruants, that ſoe they may ſee their owne
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:7498:167"/>
faults, and imperfections, and he couers and diſguiſes his guifts and graces to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that euen the man himſelfe who receiues them, may not be able expreſly to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them. And this is the common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Saints. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nimirum, conſeruandae humilitatis gratia, diuina ſolet pietas ordinare, vt quanto quis plus proficit, eo minus ſe reputet profeciſſe nam &amp; vſque ad ſupremum exercitij ſpiritualis gradum, ſi quis eo vſque peruenerit aliquid ei de primi gradus imperfectione reliquitur, vt vix ſibi primum videatur adeptus. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue Humilitie in the ſeruants of God, his diuine goodnes diſpoſes things in ſuch ſort, as that the more a man profitts, the leſſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues himſelfe to profitt: and when he is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued to the higheſt degree of vertue, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God permitts him to be ſubiect to ſome ſuch imperfection, as concernes the firſt degree; to the end that he may conceaue himſelfe not to haue fully obteyned ſo much as that;</hi> and of the ſame doth Saint Gregory ſpeake in many places.</p>
               <p>For this, doe ſome very vell compare <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie;</hi> and ſay that it reſpects other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as the ſonne doth other Starrs; and that, for this reaſon, as when the Sonne
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:7498:168"/>
appeares, other ſtarrs lye hidden, and are concealed, ſoe when <hi>Humility</hi> is in the ſowle, other vertues are not ſeene, and the humble man conceiues, that hee hath noe ſollid virtue at all. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>Boni ſoli bona ſua non vident, qui in ſe videnda omnibus ad exempla praebent. Their vertues being manifeſt to all men, onely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſee them not.</hi> The holy Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of <hi>Moyſes, that when he came from ſpeaking with God, he carried a great bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in his face, which the Children of Iſraell ſaw but for his parte, he ſaw it not. Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat quod cornuta eſſet facies eius ex conſortio ſermonis domini.</hi> So the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble man, ſees no vertues in himſelfe: all that which he ſees, ſeemes faults, and imperfections, to him. Yea and he further beleeues, that the leaſt part of his miſeries, is that which he knowes, and that he is ignorant of the greater, and now in the middſt of this, it will be eaſy for him to eſteeme himſelfe below all, and for the greateſt ſinner of the whole world.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certaine, (to the end that we may conceale nothing) that as there are many ſeuerall wayes, whereby God is wont to conduct his elect, ſoe that he leades many by this way, whereof we
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7498:168"/>
haue ſpoken, namely of concealing his guifts from them, ſoe that themſelues may not ſee them, nor conceiue that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue them; but he manifeſts them to others, and makes them know them, to the end that they may eſteeme his ſeruants &amp; be pleaſed in them. And ſe ſaith, the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paule: Nos autem non ſpiritum huius mundi accepimus, ſed ſpiritum qui ex deo est, vt ſciamus quae à Deo donata ſunt nobis. We haue not receiued the ſpirit of this world, but the ſpiritt of God; that we may know the guifts and graces, which wee receiue from his hand.</hi> And the moſt ſacred Queene of the Angells, did very well both know, and acknowledge, the great graces, and guifts, which ſhe poſſeſſed and had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Almightie God: <hi>Quia fecit mihi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gna qui potens eſt,</hi> as ſhe ſaith in her Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie, and exalt our Lord, becauſe he who is omnipotent hath wrought mightie things in me.</hi> And this is not onely not contrary to <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and perfection, but it is accompanied with an <hi>Humilitie</hi> ſoe very much eleuated, and ſoe high, that for this reaſon the Saints are wont to ſtile it, <hi>the Humilitie of great, and perfect men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet heere, theere is a great errour,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7498:169"/>
and daunger, whereof we are aduertiſed by the Saints, and it is when ſome thinke of them ſelues, that they haue more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, then indeede they haue In which errour was that miſerable creature to whome God commaunded this to be ſaid in the Apocalipſe; <hi>Dicis, diues ſum, &amp; locupletatus, &amp; nullius egeo; &amp; neſcis quia tu es miſer, &amp; miſerabilis, &amp; pauper, &amp; caecus, &amp; nudus. Thou ſayſt that thou art rich, and that thou haſt neede of nothinge, but thou dost not vnderstand thine owne caſe; for thou art miſerable, and poore, and blinde, and naked.</hi> In the ſame errour, was that Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe who gaue God thanks, that hee was not like others, beleeuing of himſelfe, that he had what indeede he had not: and that therefore he was better then other men. And ſometymes, this kinde of Pride ſteales in vpon vs, ſo ſecretely, and with ſuch diſguiſe: that almoſt before we knowe where we are, we growe very full of our ſelues, and of our owne eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. And for this, it is an excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, that wee euer carry our eyes open towards the vertues of others, and ſhutt vp towards our owne, and ſo to liue euer in a holy kinde of feare, whereby them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7498:169"/>
will be more ſafe, and the guifts of God be better kept.</p>
               <p>But yet in fine, for as much as our Lord is not tyed to this, he conducts his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants by ſeuerall wayes. Sometymes, as the Apoſtle Saint Paule ſaith, he will do his ſeruants the particuler fauour, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keing them know the guifts which they haue receiued from his hand: And in this caſe, it ſeemes that the thing in queſtion, hath more difficultie, Namely, how theis Saints, and ſpirituall men, who know and ſee in them ſelues, ſoe greate guifts which they haue receiued from God, can with truth eſteeme themſelues below all; and affirme of themſelues with all, that they are the greateſt ſinners of the whole world. When our lord conducts a man by that other way of hiding his guifts, that ſo he ſees no vertue in himſelfe, but all his faults and imperfections: the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie is not ſo great; but in theis others, how can it be? Notwithſtanding all this, it may be very well. Be you hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble like S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and you ſhall know how. His co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion preſſing to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how he could thinke and ſay ſoe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with truth; that ſeraphicall father
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7498:170"/>
made this anſwere. Really I vnderſtand it as I ſpeake it, and I beleeue, that if God had ſhewed thoſe mercies and imparted thoſe graces to any murdering theefe, or to the greateſt ſinner in the whole world which he hath vouchſafed to mee, he would haue bene much better, and much more gratefull then I. And, on the other ſide, I conceiue and beleeue, that if our Lord ſhould take off his hand from me, and not hould me faſt, I ſhould committ greater ſinnes and ſhould proue the moſt wicked man in the whole world. And for this reaſon he ſaith, <hi>I am the greatest ſinner, and the moſt vngratefull of all men.</hi> And this is a very good anſweare, and a very profound <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and it carried doctrine in it, of admirable inſtruction. This knowledge and conſideration, is that which made the Saints diue downe ſo low vnder the earth, and caſt themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues at the feete of all men, and really eſteeme themſelues, for the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the whole world: for they had that roote of <hi>Humilitie</hi> which is the knowledge of their owne miſery, and frailty, well planted and deepely rooted in their harts: and they knew very well, how to penetrate and ponder both what
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7498:170"/>
they were, and what they had of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues; and this made it eaſy for them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that if God ſhould not hould them faſt, but once take of his hand, from their heads, they would haue proued the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinners of the world: and ſo they held themſelues, for ſuch. And as for thoſe guifts and graces which they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from God, they beheld them not, as any thing of their owne, but as the goods of another, and onely lent to them. And not onely did the hauing of all theis guifts, not diſtract, or hinder them from remayning intire in their poorenes, and baſenes, or from eſteeming themſelues below all others, but it rather helpt them on towards that end, becauſe they thought they profitted, not thereby, as they ought to haue done. So that which way ſoeuer we turne our eyes, whether we caſt them inward vpon what we haue of our ſelues, or whether we caſt them vpward, vpon what we haue receiued of God; we ſhall finde occaſion enough to be humbled, and to eſteeme our ſelues below all.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> to this purpoſe, ponders thoſe words which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:7498:171"/>
after he might haue killed him in the caue into which <hi>Saul</hi> had entred. And when <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpared his life, and lett him goe, he yet went after ſaying: <hi>Quem perſequeris Rex Iſrael quem perſequeris, Canem mortuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perſequeris, &amp; pulicem vnum: Whome doſt thou perſecute O king of Iſrael? thou perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt a dead dogge and a ſingle flea, as I am;</hi> The S. ponders it thus very well, Dauid was already annoynted for king, and had vnderſtood from the Prophett <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> who anoynted him, that God would take the kingdome from <hi>Saul;</hi> and giue it him; and yet neuertheleſſe, he humbles and leſſens himſelfe before him, though he know that God had preferred him, and that in the ſight of God, he was a better man then <hi>Saul.</hi> Whereby we may learne, to eſteeme our ſelues leſſe, then them, of whome we know not, in what condition or degree they ſtand, in the preſence of Almightie God.</p>

                  <p>That this third degree of Humilitie is a good meanes, to ouercome all temptations, and to obtaine the perfection of all the vertues.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>CASSIANVS</hi> ſaith, that it was a tradition of thoſe antient fathers, &amp; as it were the firſt principle amongſt them: that a man could not obtaine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of hart, and the perfection of vertue, if firſt he did not conceiue and know, that all his induſtrie, diligence, and labour, would not be ſufficient for that purpoſe, without the eſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour &amp; helpe of God, who is the prime authour and giuer of all good things. And he ſaith more ouer, that this knowledge of his, muſt not be onely ſpeculatiue, and becauſe we haue heard it or read it, or becauſe it is a doctrine of Faith; but we muſt know it practically and by experience,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7498:172"/>
and be ſoe conuinced, ſoe reſolued, and ſetled in this truth, as if we ſaw it with our eyes, &amp; toucht it with our hands: and this is litterally the third degree of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> whereof now we treate. And of this kinde of <hi>Humilitie</hi> it is, that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of holy Scripture ſpeake, and which promiſe ſo great and euen innumerable bleſſings to ſuch as are humble. And for this reaſon, the Saints aſſigne it for the laſt, and moſt perfect degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> and ſay, That it is the foundation of all vertue, and the preparation or diſpoſition for receiuing all kinde of graces, and guifts from God. And <hi>Caſsianus,</hi> proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting this pointe more in particular, ſaith concerning Chaſtitie, that no endeauour of ours, will ſerue for the obteyning the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, till we certainly vnderſtand, that it is not to be had, but from the liberalitie and mercy of Almigthie God. And Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> agrees very wel heerewith. For the firſt and cheife meanes, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers for the acquiring and conſeruing the guift of Chaſtity, is <hi>Humility;</hi> that ſoe we may not thinke, that our owne diligences will ſuffice for this: for if we rely and reſt vpon them, we deſerue to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7498:172"/>
looſe it. But we muſt know, that it is the guift of God, and that it muſt come to vs from aboue, and that we muſt place our whole confidence in him. And ſoe one of thoſe ould Fathers ſaid, that a man would be tempted with carnall thoughts, till he come to know very well, that Chaſtity is the guift of our lord: and no acquiſition of our owne. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius</hi> confirmes this, by the example of Abbot <hi>Moyſes;</hi> whoe hauing bene a man of a ſtrange corporall ſtrength, as alſoe of a moſt vicious minde, was conuerted afterward to God, with his whole harte. At the firſt, he was grieuouſly tempted, eſpecially concerning impuritie: and by the aduiſe of thoſe Fathers, he imployed his beſt meanes to ouercome it. He prayd ſo longe, as that he paſſed ſix yeares in prayer, yea and ſpent the greateſt parte of the whole nights in prayer, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill vpon his feete. He vſed much handy labour: he eate nothing but bread; and that in ſmalle quantity: he went carrying water to the old Moncks in their Cells, and vſed many other greater mortifications and auſterityes. But yet, with all this, he came not
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7498:173"/>
to be free from his temptations; but was euen ſett on fire by them; and was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metymes in danger to fall, and to leaue the inſtitute of a Moncke. Being then in this trouble, the holy <hi>Abbott Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> came to him: and told him on the parte of God, that for that tyme forweard, his temptations ſhould ceaſe in the name of IESVS CHRIST our Lord; and ſoe they did, and neuer ſett vpon him more. And the Saint, by way of declaring the cauſe, adds this; that till then, God had not giuen compleat victory to <hi>Abbot Moyſes,</hi> leaſt he ſhould haue growne vaine and proud; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that he had conquered by his owne ſtrength: and therefore that God had, till then, permitted it for his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good. <hi>Moyſes</hi> had not yet obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the guift of diſtruſting himſelfe: and now to the end that he might obtaine it, and not grow proud by confiding in himſelfe, God left him ſoe longe a tyme, and he obteyned not by ſoe many and ſoe great indeauours, the compleate victory ouer this paſſion, which others by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence had obteyned.</p>
               <p>The like, did <hi>Palladius</hi> relate to haue
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7498:173"/>
hapned to the <hi>Abbot Pacon;</hi> for euen whilſt he was ſeauenty yeares old, he was very much moleſted by vncleane temptations: and he ſaith, that the other affirmed it to him, with an oath, that after he was fiftie yeares old, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat had bene ſoe vſuall, and ſoe very fearce, as that there had not paſſed either one day or night, in all that tyme, wherein he had not bene tempted to that ſinne. Hee did very extraordinary things to free himſelfe from theis tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations: but they did not ſerue the turne. And lamenting one day, and euen halfe fearing, that our lord had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him, he heard a voice which inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly ſaid thus to him: know, that the cauſe why god hath permitted this ſharpe aſſault to be made againſt thee, that beene to the end, that thou mightſt know thine owne pouertie, and miſerie, and the little or nothing which thou haſt of thy ſelfe; and therefore ſee that thou humble thy ſelfe heereafter, and confide not in thy ſelfe at all; but, in all things, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for helpe to me. And he ſaith, that he was ſoe comforted by this inſtruction, that he neuer felt that temptation againe.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:7498:174"/>
In fine, the will of our Lord is, that we put all our confidence in him, and that we diſtruſt our ſelues, with all our owne diligences, and meanes.</p>
               <p>This is the doctrine not onely of Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Caſsian,</hi> and thoſe antient Fathers, but of the holy Ghoſt himſelfe; and that in thoſe very termes, whereby we haue expreſſed it heere. The wiſe man, in the booke of wiſedome, ſetts expreſly downe, both the Theory and the practiſe of this pointe in theis words. <hi>Et vt ſciui quoniam aliter non poſſem eſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinens, niſi deus det, &amp; hoc ipſum erat ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia, ſcire cuius eſſet hoc donum, adij Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum &amp; deprecatus ſum illum, ex totis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Now Continent</hi> is heere, the generall word, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces not onely the conteyning, or reſtrayning that paſſion which is againſt Chaſtitie, but all the other paſſions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoe, which rebell againſt reaſon.

thinge, is ſoe much worth as the perſon, who is continent. Hee meanes, that kinde of man, who intirely contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes all his affects, and appetites, that they may not paſſe beyond the bounds of reaſon. And now, ſaith Salomon, knowing that I could not containe theis paſſions, and powers, both of my body and ſowle, within the moderation of vertue and truth, without the eſpeciall guift of God: but that ſometymes they would exceede (the knowledge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof is a high pointe of wiſedome) I had recourſe to our lord, and begged this guift of him, with my whole hart. Soe that, in fine, this is the onely meanes, whereby a man may become continent: and may be able to continue continent, to reſtraine and gouerne our paſſions and binde them to the good behauiour, and to obtaine victory ouer all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the perfection of all vertues. And ſoe the Prophet vnderſtood it rightly, when he ſaid: <hi>Niſi Dominus aedificauerit Domum, in vanum laborauerunt qui aedificant eam.

truth, and ſubſtance of the thing we ſhall not onely finde that they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, but that they are direct Siſters, and depend much vpon one another. And this he declares very well, becauſe as for the firſt, which is to enterpriſe and attempt great things, which is proper to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnanimous perſon, it is not onely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the humble man: but rather is very proper to him, and he who is the one, may well do the other. If confiding in our owne diligence, and ſtrength, wee ſhould vndertake great things, it might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and pride, becauſe we may not vndertake things either great or ſmalle, in the confidence of our owne ſtrength, for as much as, of our ſelues, <hi>we are not able to haue one good thought,</hi> as S. Paule ſaith. <hi>Non quod ſufficientes ſimus cogitare aliquid à nobis, quaſi à nobis.</hi> But the firme foundation of this vertue of <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> to attempt and enterpriſe great things, is to be by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting our ſelues, &amp; all humaine indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and to put our whole confidence in God; and this doth <hi>Humilitie</hi> alſoe, and therefore doe the Saints call it, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the vertues, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe it opens the ſoyle, and ſounds
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7498:176"/>
deepe into the very bottome, and takes out all the ſand and looſe ſtuffe, till at length it arriue to that liuing rocke, which is Chriſt our Lord, that ſoe we may build there vpon.</p>
               <p>The glorious Saint Bernard vpon that place of the Canticles. <hi>Quae eſt ita quae aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendit de deſerto, delicijs affluens, innixa ſuper dilectum ſuum: Whoe is this, which riſes vp from the deſert, abounding in delights, and leaning vpon her beloued,</hi> goes declaring how all our vertue our ſtrength, and all our good works, are to relye and reſt vpon our beloued, and he brings for an example, that of Saint Paule to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, <hi>Gratia autem Dei ſum id quod ſum; &amp; gratia eius in me vacua non fuit, ſed abundantius illis omnibus laboraui.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle beginns to recounte his labours, &amp; how much he had done in the preaching of the Ghoſpell, and in the ſeruice of the Church, till at length he came to ſay, that he had laboured more then the reſt of the Apoſtles. Saint Bernard ſaith, <hi>Take heede what you ſay O holy Apoſtle. To the end that you may be able to ſay this, yea and to the end that you may not looſe it: Innitere ſuper dilectum tuum: relye vpon your beloued,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7498:177"/>
Non ego autem ſed gratia Dei mecum. Now he relyes vpon his beloued. Not I, but the grace of God in me. And wryting to the Philippians, he ſaith omnia poſſum, I can doe all things: and then inſtantly he leanes vpon his beloued. In eo qui me confortat: In him whoe comforts me.</hi> In God we ſhall be able to doe all things: by his grace we ſhall be of power to do all things. This muſt be the foundation of our magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and of our greatnes of minde. And this is that, which the Prophett Eſay ſaith, <hi>Qui ſperant in domino mutabunt fortitudinem. They who diſtruſt themſelues, and put their whole confidence in God shall change their strength.</hi> For they ſhall chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge their ſtrength of men, which is meere weakenes, for the ſtrength of God: they ſhall change theyr arme of fleſh and blood, for the arme of our lord: and ſo they ſhall haue ſtrength for all things, for they ſhall be able to doe all things in God. And therefore did Saint Leo the Pope ſay, <hi>Nihil arduum humilibus, nihil aſperum miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> The truely humble man, is he who is magnanimous, couragious and hardy to enterpriſe, and attempt great things: or rather nothing will be hard to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he confides not in himſelfe, but in
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7498:177"/>
God, and looking vp to him, and relying vpon him, he contemnes all dangers. <hi>In Deo faciemus virtutem, &amp; ipſe ad nihilum deducet inimicos noſtros.</hi> In God we can doe all things. This is that, whereof wee heere haue much neede, a great and couragious minde and a great confidence in God, and not a weake hart which takes away our appetite from doeing our duties. Soe that in our ſelues, we muſt be humble, as knowing that of our ſelues wee are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; we can doe nothing, &amp; we are good for nothing; but in God and in his power, and grace, we are to be ſtronge harted, towards the enterpriſing of great things. S. <hi>Baſill</hi> declares this very well, vpon thoſe words of the Pro. Eſay, <hi>Ecce ego, mitte m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As if he had ſaid, for my parte I haue noe ability for ſoe high a miniſtery as that, but you are able to make me ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, you can put words into my mouth, which will haue power to make a change in the ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, God gaue him the charge, &amp; bad him

               <p>The ſecond pointe, which belongs to the magnanimous perſon, is to deſire to doe great things, and that in themſelues, they may be worthie of honour. But this alſoe is not contrary to <hi>Humilitie,</hi> becauſe as Saint Thomas ſaith very well: although the magnanimous perſon deſire to doe ſuch things, yet he deſires it not, for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7498:179"/>
honour, nor is this his end. Hee will take care indeede to deſerue it, but not either to procure, or eſteeme it. Nay rather he hath a harte, which ſoe truly deſpiſed both honour, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that be houlds nothing to be great, but vertue, and for loue thereof, hee is moued to doe great things, deſpiſing the honour which men can giue. For vertue is a thinge ſoe high, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be honoured or rewarded ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently by men, and deſerues to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and rewarded by Almightie God, and therefore the magnanimous perſon, values not all the honours of the world at a ſtrawe. It is a meane thinge, and of noe price at all with him, his flight is higher. For the onely loue of God, and vertue, is he inuited to doe great things, and he deſpiſes all the reſt. Now then, for the hauing of a hart which is ſoe great, ſoe generous, ſuch a deſpiſer of the honour, and diſhonour of men, ſuch as the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous perſon ought to haue, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he haue alſoe much <hi>Humility.</hi> To the end that a man may arriue to ſoe great perfection, as to be able to ſay with Saint Paule, <hi>Scio &amp; humiliare,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7498:179"/>
Scio &amp; abundare: vbique, &amp; in omnibus inſtitutus ſum, &amp; ſatiari &amp; eſurire, &amp; abundare &amp; penuriam pati. I know how to carry my ſelfe in humiliation, and in abon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of proſperitie, and as well in hungar, as full dyet. Per gloriam &amp; ignobilitatem, per infamiam &amp; bonam famam: vt ſeducto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res &amp; veraces, ſicut qui ignoti &amp; cogniti, quaſi morientes, &amp; ecce viuimus.</hi> To the end that ſoe ſtiffe and ſoe contrary windes, as they of honour and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of praiſe and murmuring, of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and perſecutions, may cauſe noe change in vs, nor make vs ſtumble, or ſhrinke, but that we may ſtill remaine in our owne being, it is neceſſary to haue a great foundation of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and of wiſedome from heauen. I know not whether you will be able, to keepe your ſelfe free, for the doeing of al good works, when you are in aboundance, like the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paule.</hi> As for ſuffering pouertie begging, goeinge in pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and to be humble in the midſt of diſhonours, and affronts, this perhaps you will be able to doe. But to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in honours, chaires, pulpits, and the higher ſorte of miniſteries, I know not
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7498:180"/>
whether you will be able. Alas thoſe Angells once of heauen, knew not how to doe this; but they grew proud and fell. Euen <hi>Boetius</hi> could ſay. <hi>Cum omnis fortuna timenda ſit, magis tamen timenda eſt proſpera quam aduerſa.</hi> It is harder for a man to conſerue himſelfe in <hi>Humilitie,</hi> in honour, and eſtimation of the world, and in high imployments, and miniſteries, then in diſhonour, contempt, and in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of places, which are meane and poore, for theis things draw <hi>Humilitie,</hi> after them, and thoſe others vanitie and pride. <hi>Scientia inflat:</hi> knowledge, and all other high things, do naturally puff vs vp, and make vs giddy, and therefore the Saints ſay, that it is the <hi>Humilitie</hi> of great and perfect men, to knowe how to be humble, amongſt the great guifts and graces which they receiue from God, and amongſt the honours and eſtimations of the world.</p>
               <p>They relate a thinge of the B. Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> which ſeemes very different from that other of his treading morter, that ſo he might auoyde that honour, where with they were goeing out to receiue him. For paſſinge once into a Country
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7498:180"/>
towne, they did him much honor, for the opinion and eſtimation which they held of his ſanctitie, and they all came to kiſſe his habitt, and his hands, and feete, to all which he made noe reſiſtance. His companion was inclined to thinke, that he was gladd of that honour, and the temptation did ſoe farre ouercome him, that at length he acquainted him with it: and the Saint made him this anſwear. This people, my good brother, performes noe honour at all in compariſon of what they ought to ſhew. His companion was then more ſcandaliſed, then he had bene before, for he knew not what to make of this anſweare, but the ſaynt then ſayd: <hi>This honour, my good brother which you ſee them doe me, I attribute not to my ſelfe but leaue it all to God whoſe it is: my ſelfe ſtill remayninge in the ſame profounditie of myne owne baſenes: and they, for their parts, gett well by doeing it, becauſe they acknowledge and honour God in his creature.</hi> His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion then remayned ſatisfied, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the perfection of the Saint, and he did ſoe with great reaſon. For to be held, and honoured for a Saint, which is the higheſt eſtimation, and honour,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7498:181"/>
whereof any creature is capable, and to know how to giue God the glory of it, as he ougth, without aſcribing any thinge to himſelfe, and without the ſticking of any thinge to his hands, and without takeing any vaine contentment therein, but remayning ſoe intirely in his <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and baſenes, as if no ſuch thinge had paſſed, and as if the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had not bene giuen to him, but to ſome other, is a moſt profound <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and a moſt high perfection.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt therefore procure to arriue to this <hi>Humilitie,</hi> by the grace of our Lord, we I ſay, who are called, not to the end that we ſhould be ſhutt vp in corners, or be hidden vnder a buſhell, but ſett vp on high like a Cittie vpon a hill, or like a taper vpon a Candle ſticke, to ſhine and giue light to the world. For which purpoſe it will be neceſſary for vs, to lay a very good foundation; and, for as much as is on our parte, to haue great deſire to be diſeſteemed, and deſpiſed; and that this may flow out of a profound knowledge of our owne miſerie our ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenes, and our nothing, ſuch as Saint <hi>Francis</hi> had, when hee put himſelfe to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7498:181"/>
treade morter, that ſoe he might be held for ſome meane foole. From which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge of himſelfe that deſire grew of being deſpiſed: and from thence alſoe it followed, that when afterward they did him honour, and kiſſed his habitt, and his feete, he grew not proud with all this, nor valued himſelfe one haire the more, but he remained ſoe fixt in the knowledge of his <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and meannes, as if they had done him noe honour at all, aſcribing and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>TVA ſunt omnia &amp; quae de manu tua accepimus, dedimus tibi.</hi> After king Dauid had prepared much gould, and ſiluer, and many rich materialls, for the building of the Temple, he offered them vp to God, and ſaid theis words. <hi>All things, O Lord, are thine, and that which we haue receiued at thy hands, that doe we render and returne againe.</hi> This is that, which we muſt doe and ſay, in all our good works. <hi>O Lord all our good workes are thine, and ſoe we returne what thou haſt giuen vs. Saint Auguſtine</hi> ſaith very well, <hi>Quiſquis tibi enumerat merita ſua, quid tibi enumerat niſi munera tua!</hi> Hee who putts himſelfe to recounte his meritts, and the ſeruices which he hath done thee, of what other thing doth he tell thee O Lord, but of the benefitts, and guifts
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7498:182"/>
which he hath receiued from thy holy hand. This is an effect of thy infinite mercy, and goodnes towards vs, to qualify thine owne benefitts, and guifts to vs, to be as new meritts of ours: and ſoe when thou payeſt vs for our ſeruices, thou rewardeſt thine owne benefitts, and for one grace of thine, thou giueſt vs ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for one fauour another. <hi>Gratiam pro gratia;</hi> Our Lord is content to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede with vs, like another Ioſeph, by giuing vs not onely corne, but he wil giue vs alſoe the price; and money which it coſt. <hi>Gratiam &amp; gloriam dabit Dominus; All is Gods guift, and all muſt be aſcribed, and returned to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the great helpes &amp; benefitts, which is to be reaped, by this third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Humilitie,</hi> is that it is the good, and true gratitude, &amp; thanks giuing, for the benefitts which we haue receiued at the hand of God. It is well knowne how highly the giuing of thanks, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is recomended and eſteemed in holy Scripture; ſince we ſee that when our Lord vouchſafed any remarkable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitt to his people, he inſtantly ordeyned that ſome memory or feaſt of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:7498:183"/>
ſhould be inſtituted: becauſe grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude doth much import vs, towards the receiuing of new graces and fauours. Now this is very well effected, by this third degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts as hath bene ſaid, in that a man attribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to himſelfe, but all to God; and to giue him the glory of all. For in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts true gratitude, and giuing of thanks and not in ſaying with the tongue, <hi>O Lord I giue thee thanks for thy benefitts,</hi> though yet we muſt all prayſe and giue God thanks, with the tongue. But if you ſhall doe it with the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue alone, it will not be <hi>to giue thanks,</hi> but <hi>to ſay thanks.</hi> But now to the end that it may not onely be ſaying of thanks, &amp; not onely with the mouth: but with the hart and in deede, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for vs to acknowledge, that all the good we haue is of God, and that we muſt aſcribe and returne it all to him, giuing him thanks for it all, &amp; retayning to our ſelues noe parte thereof: for in this ſort, a man ſtripps himſelfe of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which he ſees to be none of his owne, and he giues it to God whoſe it is. And this did Chriſt our lord intend to make vs knowe, in the holy Ghoſpell,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7498:183"/>
when hauing cured thoſe Leapers, and one only returning to giue him thanks for the benefitt, which they had all recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he ſaid thus: <hi>Non eſt inuentus qui re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diret, &amp; daret gloriam deo, niſi hic alieni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena.

               <p>From hence alſoe growes another benefitt, and good, that the true hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, though he haue many guifts of God, and be much eſteemed and valued by the whole world for them, doth not yet eſteeme and value himſelfe, one haire the more, for that: but remaines ſo firme in the knowledge of his owne baſenes, as if none of that which they aſcribed, were to be found in him. For hee knowes
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7498:184"/>
very well, how to diſtinguiſh that which is his owne, from that which belongs to another: and to aſſigne to euery one his owne: and ſoe he behoulds the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitts and graces which he hath receiued from God, not as his owne, but as anothers; by whome they were lent, and he alſoe lodges his eyes vpon his owne baſenes, and miſery, and vpon that which he would not faile to be, if God ſhould take off his hand, euen for one minute, and were not euer conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and houlding him vp. Yea and euen whilſt he is receiuinge the guifts of God, he is the more humbled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded thereby. Saint <hi>Dorotheus</hi> ſaith, <q>that as it happens with trees, which are mightily loaden with fruite, the ſame very fruite makes the boughes ſtoope, and abaſe themſelues; and that, ſometymes ſoe farre, as to breake them with their great weight, whereas the boughes which beare no fruite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine perking vp, and high; and as eares of corne, when they are very full, hange downe their heades, ſo farre that they ſeeme, as if they would euen breake the ſtalke, whereon they
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7498:185"/>
growe: and when they ſtand boult vp right, it is a ſhrewd ſigne that they haue nothinge in them; ſoe it hapneth, ſaith hee, in the way of ſpiritt, that they who are emptie, and without fruite, looke bigge, and loftie, and hould themſelues for gallant men: but they, on the other ſide, who are much loaden with fruite, and are full of the graces, and guifts of God, are the more humbled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded thereby.</q> For euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe very benefitts, and guifts, the true ſeruants of God, take occaſion to be the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, &amp; to walke with the more warines and feare. <hi>S. Gregory</hi> ſaith, that as a man <q>who hath borrowed great ſummes of money, is gladd in ſuch ſorte, that he hath borrowed it, as that yet his ioy of haueing receiued it, is very ſufficiently watered, by the knowinge that he is in obligation to pay it againe; and care, to conſider, whether he ſhall be able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply when his bond is due; ſoe the man whoe is truly humble, the more guifts he hath receiued, he acknowledges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſoe much the more deepely a debtor, to Almighty God, and ſoe much the more bounde to ſerue him; and he is
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7498:185"/>
ſtil thinking, that he correſponds not to thoſe greater fauours, by grater ſeruices, nor to greater graces by greater thanks; and he conceiues and beleeues, that to whome ſoeuer God would haue ſhewed that goodnes, which he had ſhewed to him, that man would haue made better vſe of it, and would haue bene more gratefull, and a better man.</q> And ſoe, one of the conſiderations which makes the true ſeruants of God to be very much humbled and confounded is this; They know that God will not onely call them to an accounte for their ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but for his fauours alſoe receiued: and they know that to whome God giues much, from him he will require much and to whome he giues more, of him he will alſoe require more. <hi>Omni autem cui multum datum est, multum queretur ab eo, &amp; eui commendauerunt multùm, plus petent ab eo.</hi> The Abbott Macarius ſaith, <q>that the humble man lookes vpon the guifts and fauours of God, as ſome depoſitary or treaſurer would doe, who had his Maſters goods in his hands; for ſuch a one will rather be in feare and care, then in pride, leaſt
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7498:186"/>
ſome what ſhould, by his fault be loſt, when they call him to make vp his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From hence alſoe growes yet another good, which is, that the man who is truly humble, diſeſteemes or deſpiſes no other man, into what ſoeuer defects and ſinnes he may perhaps ſee him fall, nor will he thereby growe proude, or eſteeme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the more, for that; but rather will take occaſion thereby, to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the more by hauing ſeene him fall, through the conſideration that the other, and himſelfe, are both made of the ſame mould, and that when the other falls, hee alſoe falls, for as much as he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, For, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, <hi>there is no ſinne which is committed by any one, which another man would not, or might not committ, if the hand of Gods mercy with-held him not.</hi> And ſoe one of thoſe antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when he heard that any man had falne, was wont to weepe bitterly, and ſay, <hi>Ille hodie, &amp; ego cras. To day for him, and to morrowe for me.</hi> As he fell, I might as well haue falne, ſince I am a weake man as he is. <hi>Homo ſum, &amp; humanum ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil a me alienum puto</hi> I muſt eſteeme it, as
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7498:186"/>
a moſt particular bleſſing of our lord, that I fell not too. Thus doe all the Saints aduiſe vs, that whenſoeuer we ſee one man blinde another deafe, another lame, another maymd, or ſicke: we muſt eſteeme all thoſe miſeries of theirs, to be benefitts of ours, &amp; giue thanks to God, for not hauing made vs blinde, or deafe, or lame, or maymd, as he made him. And ſoe alſo muſt we make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, that the ſinnes of all other men, are as ſoe many benefitts of our owne, for I might haue committed them all, if our Lord out of his infinite mercy, had not defended me. By this meanes, the ſeruants of God preſerue themſelues in <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and in not deſpiſing their neighbours, and in not carrying them ſelues high againſt others: for what-ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer faults or ſinnes they diſcerne in them, according to that of Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, Vera iustitia compaſsionem habet, falſa iuſtitia dedignationem; true iuſtice makes vs haue compaſsion of our neighbours, and falſe iustice diſdaine and ſcorne.</hi> But ſuch men as theis, haue reaſon to be afraid of that, which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>Conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7498:189"/>
attributes nothing to himſelfe: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynely aſcribes and reſtores all to God, and giues him the honour, and glory of all. <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for clay breedes no ſuch commodity as that.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:7498:193"/>
ſtill finde our ſelues to ſtumble, and dayly to falle in meane things, and very eaſy to be withſtood, we may be very certaine, that in our ſelues we haue noe meanes to auoide ſuch as are greater: and that ſoe we may not be proud, when there is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of great things, nor attribut any things to our ſelues, but walke euer on with <hi>Humilitie,</hi> and feare, and beſeech our lord to ſhew vs fauour and grace. Saint Bernard ſaith the ſame, and it is the common doctrine of the Saints. Saint Auguſtine, vpon thoſe words: <hi>Et ſine ipſo factum eſt nihil,</hi> and Saint Ierome, vpon that of the Prophett Ioel: <hi>Et reddam vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, auos quos comedit locuſta, bruchus, &amp; rubigo, &amp; eruca,</hi> ſay that to humble a man, and to tame his pride, God created theis little animalls, and poore baſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes which are ſoe troubleſome to vs, and that the proud people of Pharao, might eſily haue bene tamed and humbled, if God would haue ſent beares, Lions, and Serpents, in vpon them; but he thought fitt to tame their pride, by the baſeſt ſort of creatures, as gnatts, flyes, and froggs, that he might humble them ſo much the more. And ſo alſo, to the end
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:7498:194"/>
that we may be humbled, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, God permitts vs to fall into little faults; and giues way that ſome poore, and weake te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations, which are like gnats, and ſeeme not, indeede to haue any body, or bulke in them, may ſometymes make warre againſt vs. If we will pauſe to conſider attentiuely, what is wont ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes to diſquiet, and put vs from our caſe: we ſhall finde that they are certaine bawblinge things, which being ſifted, and diſcouered well, haue noe ſubſtance in them at all. <hi>I know not what little word they ſaid to me; or elſe they ſaid it to me in ſuch a manner: or me thought they made light of me,</hi> and the like. Of a flye which paſſes through the ayre, a man ſometymes will build a whole tower of winde, and then adding one thing to another, it ſhall ſerue to make his hart very vnquiet. What would then become of vs, if God ſhould let looſe ſome Lion or Tygar againſt vs, when we are put into ſuch diſorder, by a gnatt? What would become of vs, if we were ſett vpon, by ſome greiuous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation! And thus are we to draw more <hi>Humilitie</hi> and confuſion, out of ſuch things as theis. And if as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:7498:194"/>
this be drawne from thence, <hi>Pia diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatione nobiſcum agitur, vt non paenitus aufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur.</hi> It is a great mercy and benefitt and fauour of God, that ſuch toyes as thoſe, may not be wanting to vs, and that this may be able to make vs humble.</p>
               <p>But if theis ſlight things will not ſerue the turne, then know, that God will paſſe further on, and that very much to your coſt, for ſoe he is accuſtomed to doe. God, doth ſoe highly abhorre preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and pride, and loues <hi>Humilitie,</hi> ſoe much, that the ſaynts affirme, that he is wont, through his iuſt and moſt ſecrett iudgement, to permitt that a man may fall into mortall ſinnes, to the end that he may be humbled thereby, yea and euen into carnall ſinnes which are the moſt vgly, and full of ſhame, to the end that they may be humbled the more. They ſay <hi>that he punishes ſecrett pride, with open luſt.</hi> And to this purpoſe they bring that which Saint Paule ſaid of thoſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, whome for theyr pride, <hi>God deliuered ouer to the deſires of their harts. In immunditiam, vt contumelijs afficiant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora ſua, in ſemetipſos, in paſsiones ignonimiae. They came to fall into vncleane ſinnes, which were moſt filthy, and not to be named;</hi> God
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7498:195"/>
permitting it ſoe for their pride, to the end that they might be humbled, and confounded, when they ſaw themſelues turned beaſts, with the harte, and conuerſation, and cuſtome of beaſts. <hi>Quis non time bit te O Rex gentium? Who will not be afraide of thee, O thou king of the Nations?</hi> who will not tremble at this puniſhment, which is ſoe great as that there is none greater out of Hell? Nay ſinne is euen worſe then Hell. <hi>Quis nouit poteſtatem irae tuae &amp; prae timore tuo iram tuam dinumerare. Who O lord hath knowne the power of thy wrath or who is able to relate it through the great feare which ought to be had thereof.</hi>

               <p>The Saints note, that God in theis caſes is wont to vſe two kindes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards vs, a greater mercy and a leſſe. The leſſe mercy is, when he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours vs in our leſſe miſeries, which are the temporall, and ſuch as onely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the body; and the great mercy, is when he ſuccours vs in our great miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are the ſpirituall, and which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

the adultery and murder which he had committed, he cryed out, and beggs the great mercy of God: <hi>Miſerere mei Deus, ſecundum magnam miſericordiam tuam.</hi> They ſay alſoe that there is a great, and a little anger of God. The leſſer is, when he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes men heere, in the Temporall, with aduerſities, in loſſe of goods, of honour, health, and the like, which onely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the body; but the great anger is, when the puniſhment goes ſoe farre, that it arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to the interiour part of the ſowle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, Ecce peruenit gladius vſque ad animam.</hi> And this is that wich God ſaith by the Prophett <hi>Zacharie. Iramagna ego iraſcor, ſuper gentes opulentas.</hi> I will be angry, with my great Anger, with that Nation, which is proud and puffed vp. When God forſakes a man, &amp; permitts him to fall into mortall ſinnes in puniſhment of his other ſinnes, this is the great anger of God; theis are wounds which are giuen by diuine indignation, &amp; they are not as of a father but as of a iuſt and rigorous iudge. Of which wounds, that of the Prophett Ieremy, may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: <hi>Plagainimici percuſsi te caſtigatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne crudeli. I haue wounded thee with the
<pb facs="tcp:7498:196"/>
wound of an enemy, with a cruell punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And ſoe alſoe ſaith the wiſeman. <hi>Fouea profunda os leoenae, cui iratus eſt domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus incidet in eam. The mouth of a lewd wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is a deepe ditch, and he with whome God is angry, shall fall into it.</hi> Finally, pride is ſoe wicked a thing, and ſoe much abhorred by Almightie God, that the Saints ſay, that ſometymes it is good for the proud man, to be thus puniſhed by Almightie God: that ſoe he may come to be cured of his pride. Soe ſaith Saint Auguſtine: <hi>Audeo dicere, ſuperbis eſſe vtile, cadere in aliquod vitium apertum, manifeſtumque peccatum, vnde ſibi diſpliceant, qui ſibi iam ceciderant.</hi> I preſume to ſay, that it is profitable and good, for proud men, that God permitt them to falle into ſome viſible and externall ſinne, that ſoe they whoe were very well ſatisfied and pleaſed in themſelues and were already falne, though they perceiued it not, may ſoe begin to know, and to humble and diſtruſt themſelues, according to that of the wiſeman: <hi>Contritio praecedit ſuperbiam, &amp; ante ruinam exaltatur ſpiritus.</hi> The ſame doe Saint <hi>Baſill,</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Saint Gregory, by the occaſion of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7498:196"/>
the ſinne of Dauid, why God permitts that the elect, and ſuch as he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to aeternalle life, and on who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he had heaped vp his graces, and guifts, ſhould fall ſometymes into car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and filthy ſinnes; and he anſweares that the reaſon of it is, becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, they who haue receiued great graces fall into pride, and they haue it ſoe rooted, and euen wrought into the moſt intimous parte of the hart; that they themſelues vnderſtand it not, but are ſoe well pleaſed, and confident of themſelues, as to thinke that God and they, are all one. As it hapned to Saint Peter, the Apoſtle, who conceiued not, that thoſe words of his, had flowed from pride, when he ſaid, <hi>Though all men should be ſcandaliſed, yet will not I be ſcandaliſed:</hi> but he thought that it had bene courage in him, and an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary loue which he carryed to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Therefore to cure ſuch pride as this, which lyes ſo cloſe and is ſoe diſguiſed, as that a man is already falne, though himſelfe perceiue it not, our lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitts ſometymes, that ſuch perſons falle into certaine manifeſt, exteriour
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7498:197"/>
cornall filthy ſinnes; to the end that ſoe they may know themſelues better, and looke more exactly in to their ſowles: and may ſoe come to perceiue their pride, which they beleeued not to be in them before: and whereof they looke for noe remedy, &amp; would ſo haue come to periſh, but now by meanes of ſuch groſſe falls, they know it, and being humbled now in the ſight of God, they doe penance both for the one and the other, and ſoe meete with remedy for both their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at once, as we ſee S. Peter did: who by that viſible &amp; aparant fall of his, came to know that pride which lay ſoe ſecretly within, and he grew to lament it, and to doe penance for them both: and thus was his fall good for him. The ſame hapned alſo to Dauid, whoe therefore ſaith, <hi>Bonum eſt mihi quia humiliaſti me, vt diſcam iuſtificationes tuas.</hi> O Lord it hath coſt me deere, I confeſſe it, but yet, vpon the whole matter, <hi>it hath bene good for me that I haue bene humbled</hi> that ſoe heere after, I may learne to ſerue thee, and know how to abaſe my ſelfe as I ought. And as the wiſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, when he is not able to cure the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7498:197"/>
malady out right, and when the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humour is ſoe rebellious, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne, that he cannot make nature digeſt, and ouercome it, procures to call and drawe it into the exteriour parts of the body, that ſo it may be the better cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed: iuſt ſoe, for the cure of certaine haughty and rebellious ſowles, doth our Lord permitt them to fall into greiuous &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour ſinnes, to the end that they may know, and humble themſelues: and by meanes of that abaſement which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares without, the maligne and peſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent humour may be alſoe cured, which lay cloſe within. <hi>And this is a word which God works in Iſraell, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer comes to heere, his very eares shall euen tingle for meere feare:</hi> theis I ſay, are thoſe great puniſhments of God, the onely hearing whereof, is able to make men tremble, from head to foote.</p>
               <p>But yet our Lord whoe is ſoe full of benignitie and mercy, doth neuer imploy this ſoe rigorous puniſhment, nor this ſo lamentable and vnhappy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, but after haueing vſed other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which were moſt gentle and ſweete.
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7498:198"/>
Hee firſt ſends vs other occaſions, and other more gentle inducements, that ſo wee may humble our ſelues. Sometymes ſicknes, ſometymes a contradiction, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metymes a murmuration, and ſometymes a diſhonour, when a man is brought lower then he thought. But when theis temporall things will not ſerue the turne to humble vs, he paſſes on to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall: and firſt, to things of leſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and afterward by permitting fearce and greiuous temptations, ſuch as may bringe vs ſo within a haires bredth, and euen perſwade vs, or at leaſt make vs doubt, whether wee conſented or noe. That ſo a man may ſee, and finde by good experience, that he cannot ouercome them by himſelfe, but may experimentally vnderſtand his owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and the preciſe neede which he hath of helpe from heauen: and ſoe may come to diſtruſt his owne ſtrenght, and may humble himſelfe. And when all this will not ſerue, then comes that other ſo violent, and ſoe coſtly cure, of ſuffering a man to fall into mortall ſinne, and to be ſubdued by the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then comes this Canterie, which
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7498:198"/>
is made euen by the very fire of Hell; to the end that after a man hath euen as it were beaten out his braines, he may fall at length, vpon the iuſt examination, and knowledge of what he is and may at length be content to humble himſelfe, by this meanes, ſince he would not be brought to doe it by any other.</p>
               <p>By this tyme I hope wee ſee well, how mightily it imports vs, to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not to confide or preſume vpon our ſelues, and therefore lett euery one enter into accounte with his owne harte, and conſider what profitt hee reapes, by thoſe occaſions which God dayly ſends, for the making him humble, in the qualitie of a tender harted Phiſition, and of a Father, that ſo there may be no neede of thoſe other which are ſo violent. Chaſtiſe me, O Lord, with the Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſement of a Father: cure thou my pride with afflictions, diſeaſes, diſhonours and affronts, and with as many humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations as thou canſt be pleaſed to ſend: but ſuffer not, O Lord, that I ſhould euer fall into mortall ſinne. O Lord lett the diuell haue power to touch me in pointe of honour, and in my health;
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:7498:199"/>
and lett him make another Iob of me: <hi>Verumtamen animam meam ſerua:</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not that he may euer touch my ſoule.

               <p>SEVERVS <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> and <hi>Surius,</hi> in the life of Saint <hi>Seuerinus</hi> the Abbot, relates of a certaine man, who was very remarkeable both for his vertues and miracles, that he gaue health to ſicke perſons and diſpoſſeſſed men of deuills, and did many other wonderfull things; for which they flocked to him from all parts, and he was viſited by Prelates, and great lords; yea and they held it for a pointe of happines, if they might but touch euen his cloathes: and if he would giue them his benediction. By the vſe of theis things, the Saint began to perceiue, that a certaine vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was growing to enter vpon his hart. And on the one ſide, finding that he was not able to diuert his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:7498:200"/>
of people, and that he could not, on the other, deliuer himſelfe from thoſe importunate thoughts of vanity, which preſſed vpon him: he was much afflicted therewith, and putting himſelfe one day in prayer, he beſought our lord with greate inſtance, that for the remedy of thoſe temptations, and to the end that he might be conſerued in <hi>Humilitie,</hi> his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie would permitt, and giue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to the diuell to enter into his body for ſometyme: and torment him as he did other perſons. God heard his prayer, and the diuell entred into him, and it was matter of Wonder, and a mazement, to ſee him bound vp in Chaines, as a fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke and poſſeſſed man, and ſoe to be carryed to others to be exerciſed, to whome not longe before, they had bene wont to bringe poſſeſſed perſons, that they might be cured by him. Thus he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned fiue moneths: and at the end the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, the ſtory ſaith, that he was cured, and freed, not onely from the diuell whoe had poſſeſt his body, but from that pride alſoe and vanitie, which had poſſeſt his ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Surius</hi> relates another example like this
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7498:200"/>
and ſaith, that the holy Abbot <hi>Seuerinus</hi> had in his Monaſtery three Monckes, who were a little high and toucht with vanitie, and pride. Hee had admoniſhed them thereof, and yet they perſeuered in their faulte. The Saynt through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he had to ſee them reformed, and humble, beſought our lord with teares that he would correct them with ſome puniſhment of his owne hand: that ſoe they might be humbled, and reformed: and before he roſe vp from prayer, our lord permitted that three diuells might poſſeſſe them, by whome they were greiuouſly tormented: and they confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, with loud cryes, the pride and hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of ther owne harts. A puniſhment very proportionable to the faulte, that the ſpiritt of pride ſhould enter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit men, who were full of vanitie and pride. And becauſe our lord ſaw well, that nothing would be ſoe able to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, he ſuffered them to remaine ſoe forty dayes: at the end whereof the Saynt beſought our Lord, that he would be pleaſed to free them from the diuell, which he obteyned; and ſoe they remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſound both in body and ſowle, when
<pb facs="tcp:7498:201"/>
once they had bene thus humbled by this puniſhment of our Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ceſarius</hi> writes, how they brought a certaine poſſeſſed perſon to a Couent of the <hi>Ciſtertian</hi> Moncks to be recouered. The Prior went out to meete him, and in his company a yonge Religious man, of whoſe vertue otherwiſe, there was a greate opinion, beſides that he was knowne to be a Virgin. The Prior ſaid then to the diuell. It this Moncke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde thee to depart, dareſt thou yet remaine? To which the diuell made this anſwere. I feare not him, for he is proud.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Iohn Climacus</hi> relates, how once the diuell began to ſow certaine prayſes, in the hart of a moſt valliant Cauallier of Chriſt, who was running on a pace, towards this vertue of <hi>Humilitie.</hi> But he being moued by the inſpiration of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, mett with a very ſhort way, for ouercominge the mallice of thoſe peruerſe ſpiritts; and it was, that he wrote vpon the wall of his Cell, the names o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

thoughts of pride began to tempt him, he made this anſweare.

No for I haue many ill thoughts, yea and I finde many ill motions in my ſelfe. Moſt high Prayer? No, for I am much distracted, and ſleeppy therein,</hi> And then he ſaid thus to himſelfe; <hi>When thou shalt haue obteyned all theis vertues, ſay yet that thou art an vnfruitefull and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſeruant, and for ſuch muſt thou hould thy ſelfe, according to thoſe words of Christ our Lord, Cum feceritis omnia quae praecepta ſunt vobis, Dicite ſerui inutiles ſumus.</hi> But now when thou art ſoe farre off what canſt thou thinke of thy ſelfe.</p>
